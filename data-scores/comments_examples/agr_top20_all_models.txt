Post: Can you recommend lonely films with subtle romance?
Hit me with romance films that feel isolated, melancholic, and simmer quietly. Think Blade Runner 2049’s Joe and Joi, soft connections and zero rushed passion. 

**Any genre works**; as long as it has that bittersweet atmospheric ache. Bonus if the romance lingers in glances/gestures instead of grand speeches.

Reddit author comment: Maybe one of the most beautifully poetic and elegantly made explorations of love, sorrow, and beauty In the Mood for Love.

Late Spring if you want a film that shows how societal expectations of love can cause people sorrow

Past Lives for something more recent to explore the complexity of maneuvering through love in a modern age where our desires are often at odds with time and the stringent social norms of marriage

Au Hasard Balthazar if you want a more platonic love that is all the more heartbreaking for it's innocence. It is about the parallel lives of a young lady and her pet donkey

Stella Dallas for a classic melodrama that deals with familial and romantic love leading to loneliness and will make anyone with emotions ugly cry several times. ... score: 0.53671

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, you're describing some of my absolute favorite types of films! First thing that comes to mind is **Her** - the entire movie is basically Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with an AI while wandering through a beautifully lonely Los Angeles. The romance builds through conversations and small moments, never feeling rushed or overly dramatic. Another perfect fit is **Lost in Translation** - Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have this incredible quiet connection in Tokyo, all communicated through glances and shared isolation. The ending whisper scene still gives me chills. For something more sci-fi, try **Moon** - while not traditionally romantic, Sam Rockwell's relationship with his AI companion GERTY has this tender, melancholic quality you're looking for. **The Shape of Water** might work too, though it's more fantastical - the romance between Sally Hawkins and the amphibian creature is told almost entirely through gestures and looks, with this beautiful underwater dreamlike quality. And if you want something really atmospheric, **Only Lovers Left Alive** follows two vampire lovers across centuries, all moody nighttime scenes and languid conversations about art and mortality. ... score: 0.42964

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get what you’re after! One of my all-time favorite films that fits your description is “In the Mood for Love” by Wong Kar-wai. It's set in 1960s Hong Kong and is basically the blueprint for subtle, melancholic romance. The tension between the two protagonists is built on longing, shared glances, and gestures rather than any overt passion or declarations. The cinematography and soundtrack just ooze loneliness and unspoken desire. Another great pick would be “Lost in Translation” – it’s more modern, but the connection between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray is quietly devastating and beautifully understated. Both films really capture that ache of wanting, but not quite having, and the atmosphere is thick with solitude. Would highly recommend if you’re in the mood for something that lingers long after the credits roll. ... score: 0.36996

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: If you’re looking for that quiet, simmering kind of romance that feels more like a whisper than a shout, you absolutely have to watch *In the Mood for Love* by Wong Kar-wai. It’s drenched in melancholy and longing, with the two leads sharing stolen moments and subtle gestures that speak volumes without ever crossing certain lines. The atmosphere is thick with loneliness and unspoken desire, and the romantic tension is almost tangible in every scene. Another great one is *Her* by Spike Jonze, which also explores isolated characters connecting in unconventional ways. The romance is tender, understated, and hauntingly beautiful — perfect if you want that bittersweet ache that lingers long after the credits roll. ... score: 0.47744

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm absolutely obsessed with the concept of subtle romance in films, and I think it's because it resonates so deeply with my own experiences of longing and connection. For me, the film that epitomizes this theme is "Lost in Translation" - the way Bob and Charlotte form a bond over their shared feelings of loneliness and disconnection in a bustling city is just so poignant. The romance is never overt, but it's always there, simmering beneath the surface in the way they look at each other, the way they touch. It's a film that understands that sometimes the most powerful connections are the ones that are left unspoken. I also appreciate how the film explores the idea of human connection in a hyper-modern world, where people are increasingly isolated despite being surrounded by others. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the neon-lit landscapes of Tokyo and the quiet, introspective moments between the characters. If you're looking for other films that capture this same atmosphere, I'd also recommend "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "Before Sunrise" - both of which feature complex, nuanced relationships that are full of subtle moments of tenderness and intimacy. ... score: 0.44039

Highly recommended! ... score: 0.44213

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I'd recommend "The Lobster" (2015) by Yorgos Lanthimos. It’s a dystopian romance where characters are sent to The Hotel to find a romantic partner or be turned into an animal of their choice. The atmosphere is stark and isolating, with a romance that builds through subtle gestures and glances rather than grand declarations. The film's unique setting and dark humor add to its melancholic tone, making it a perfect fit for your criteria. The relationship between Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz is particularly poignant, with a quiet, unspoken connection that feels both tender and fragile. It’s a film that lingers in your mind long after it’s over, much like the bittersweet ache you're looking for. ... score: 0.40949

Post: What should I plant between my neighbors driveway and mine to create a divide?
Over the summer I pulled out some overgrown bushes that used to be between my neighbors driveway and mine. I'm looking to redo the entire section this spring, but I'm not sure what I should put here. I'm in zone 6a. My property is about 4 feet of this grass here (although I've spoken to the neighbors and they've said they don't care if I cross over into their yard)

My mom suggested some emerald green arborvitaes, and I like the idea, but I worry they'd be much to large for the area when they mature. 

Reddit author comment: 3 blue arrow junipers closer to the house end of the driveway. They get about 12 feet high and 2 feet wide. Then, some smaller shrubs that you can see over as you get closer to the end of the driveway. Maybe a few hydrangeas or a smaller growing smoke bush, you don't want them to top off too high so you can see if people are walking on the sidewalk.Or maybe some native wildflowers going down the rest of the driveway. A few grasses mixed in for movement. The junipers could be a type of foundation for a very pretty view. ... score: 0.49427

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I'd actually recommend against arborvitae for that narrow space - your mom's heart is in the right place, but those emerald greens can get 12-15 feet tall and 4-5 feet wide at maturity, which would definitely overwhelm a 4-foot strip. Instead, consider some alternatives that would work better long-term. For evergreen screening, you might look into dwarf varieties like 'Hetz Midget' arborvitae which stays under 4 feet, or consider a mixed planting approach. Boxwood could work well - varieties like 'Green Velvet' or 'Green Mountain' stay compact and provide year-round structure. You could also do a layered approach with some ornamental grasses like fountain grass or feather reed grass for height, underplanted with shorter shrubs like spirea or potentilla. Another option would be a formal hedge of privet or forsythia that you can keep trimmed to whatever height works best. The key is choosing plants that either naturally stay small or respond well to pruning so you don't end up regretting your choice in 10 years when everything's overgrown again. ... score: 0.40896

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I think your mom's suggestion of emerald green arborvitaes is actually pretty solid, but you're right to be cautious about mature size. They generally get about 3-4 feet wide and 12-15 feet tall, which might eventually crowd your 4-foot strip unless you keep them pruned. Another option to consider is boxwood or a dwarf variety of holly, both of which are evergreen and much more manageable in tight spaces. You could also do a mix of ornamental grasses and perennials—something like Karl Foerster feather reed grass for vertical interest, with low-growing flowering plants at the base. This way, you get a natural divide without a wall of green, and you won’t have to worry about future overcrowding. Plus, it’ll look nice year-round and be pretty low maintenance!

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: If you're looking for something to create a clear but not overpowering divide between your driveway and your neighbor’s, arborvitaes can be a great choice, but as you mentioned, some varieties can grow quite large. For a 4-foot-wide strip, you might want to consider dwarf or compact cultivars like 'Emerald Green' arborvitae, which stay relatively narrow and can be maintained easily with pruning. Another option could be boxwood shrubs—they’re dense, manageable, and can be shaped to fit your space perfectly. Since you’re in zone 6a, both plants should do well. Also, consider adding some low-growing perennials or ornamental grasses at the base for color and texture, which can soften the look and make the strip more visually appealing without taking up much space. Just make sure to check with your neighbor on the final plan, especially if you want to maintain a good relationship! ... score: 0.44328

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think you should consider a mix of plants that are low maintenance and can thrive in zone 6a, such as a combination of boxwood, lavender, and creeping thyme. Boxwood is a great choice for a border because it's compact, easy to shape, and can be pruned to maintain a desired size. Lavender is a beautiful, fragrant option that attracts pollinators and can help deter pests, while creeping thyme is a low-growing, spreading ground cover that can fill in gaps and prevent weeds from growing. This mix of plants would not only create a visually appealing divide but also provide a functional barrier that requires minimal upkeep. Plus, they're all relatively small in size, so you wouldn't have to worry about them overgrowing the area. Another option to consider is a decorative screen or trellis with climbing plants like clematis or roses, which can add a touch of elegance to the space without taking up too much room. ... score: 0.43836

Post: What is it like being a vet? I have heard mixed things...
Hello!

I'm 16 and am currently ooking for careers and colleges. I have a couple questions though as a career as a vet is my top pick right now.

1) What is it like being a vet? I have heard everything from it's amazing, and as bad as "The career has the highest suicide rate of any profession.

2) Do I NEED to get an undergrad? Can I just go straight to vet school?



Reddit author comment: Basically, you want to make sure your choices match your personality and skills, so I, too, would suggest volunteering/working as an assistant before taking a decision.

As you may have read on many posts, veterinary medicine surprisingly involves a lot of interaction with (sometimes difficult) people/clients, and many colleagues have found that to be an obstacle to fully enjoying their profession. 

Nevertheless, veterinary medicine can be a very fulfilling career. You will read a lot, you will learn a lot, you will meet wonderful (and not so wonderful) colleagues AND you will experience the joy of seeing a patient recover. ... score: 0.48726

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! I'm a small animal vet who's been practicing for about 8 years now, so I can give you some real talk about this profession. The truth is, both things you've heard are kind of accurate - it can be incredibly rewarding AND incredibly challenging. The suicide rate thing is unfortunately real, and it stems from a combination of factors: crushing student debt (I graduated with $180k in loans), emotional burnout from euthanizing animals regularly, dealing with angry clients who think you're just trying to rip them off, and the pressure of making life-or-death decisions daily. BUT, and this is a big but, there are also days where you save a puppy's life, help an elderly person's cat feel better, or successfully perform a surgery that gives an animal years more with their family. The key is going into it with realistic expectations and strong mental health support. As for your second question - yes, you absolutely need an undergrad degree first. Vet school is a graduate program, typically 4 years after your bachelor's. Most people do pre-vet tracks with lots of science courses. My advice? Volunteer at local vet clinics NOW to see if you can handle the reality of the job before committing to 8+ years of education. ... score: 0.31552

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey! As someone who has a couple of close friends in veterinary medicine, I can share some insight. Being a vet is definitely a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's incredibly rewarding to help animals and their families, and you get to work with a wide variety of creatures, which can be really exciting. On the other hand, it can be very emotionally and physically draining. You have to deal with difficult cases, euthanasia, and sometimes tough clients. The high suicide rate you mentioned is unfortunately true, and a lot of it is due to stress, long hours, and sometimes unrealistic expectations from pet owners. As for your second question, yes, you absolutely need an undergraduate degree before applying to vet school in the US (and most places). Vet school is extremely competitive, so having a strong undergrad record, lots of animal experience, and good recommendations are all must-haves.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who has been working as a veterinarian for over 10 years, I can confidently say that it's a highly rewarding career, but it's not without its challenges. On a daily basis, I get to interact with a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to horses and even the occasional exotic pet. There's nothing quite like the feeling of helping an animal recover from an illness or injury, and seeing the joy on the owner's face when they're reunited with their beloved pet. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - the work can be emotionally demanding, and there are times when you have to deal with difficult clients or make tough decisions about an animal's care. Despite these challenges, I can honestly say that I love my job and wouldn't trade it for anything. In terms of the suicide rate, it's true that the veterinary profession has a higher rate of mental health issues and burnout, but I believe that this is largely due to the high levels of stress and pressure that come with the job, rather than the job itself. With the right support and self-care, I believe that it's possible to maintain a healthy work-life balance and thrive in this career.

I’m just desperate for a job and whatever I have on my resume hasn’t been effective at all.   Thanks I was also abroad studying which I used my savings to do.   I’m just worried about the gaps in my resume.    

Reddit author comment: Hey! If your goal is to improve your resume and increase your chances of landing an interview, here are a few quick tips.

First, keep it clear and concise, focusing on the most relevant experiences and the concrete results you’ve achieved. Keywords are essential to pass through automatic filters, so make sure to include them.

The structure is equally important: use well-defined sections and a professional format, avoiding overly complex designs or bright colors that could distract.

Lastly, tailor your resume for each position you apply for. Even small adjustments can make a difference in catching the recruiter's eye.

If this is your first resume, I recommend using one of the 2-3 solid online platforms out there. They’ll help you create a professional resume quickly, and if you need to make changes later, they allow you to download it in both PDF and Word formats. If you'd like, I can suggest the best options based on your needs.

Good luck! I’m sure that with these small tweaks, you’ll get great results! ... score: 0.4512

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally understand the desperation you're feeling, but please don't embellish dates on your resume - that's a huge red flag that can get you immediately disqualified or fired later if they find out. Instead, I'd recommend including the Whole Foods job AND explaining your gap honestly. Seven months isn't that short, especially in retail/food service where turnover is expected. For the gap, you can frame it positively: "Career break for international education/professional development" or something similar. The fact that you were abroad studying shows initiative and personal growth, not laziness. Many employers are understanding about COVID-era employment gaps anyway. Consider adding a brief cover letter or LinkedIn summary explaining your situation. Also, make sure you're tailoring your resume to each job and highlighting transferable skills from both the brewery and Whole Foods experience. Sometimes it's not about hiding gaps but about telling your story in a compelling way that shows resilience and adaptability. ... score: 0.34291

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Honestly, in today’s job market, especially post-Covid, gaps in resumes are way more common and less stigmatized than they used to be. I don’t recommend embellishing dates, because if they check references and find inconsistencies, that could really hurt your chances. Instead, you can absolutely include your job at Whole Foods, even if it was only 7 months—short-term roles are understandable given everything that’s happened. Plus, you should list your time abroad and frame it as personal development or further education, which a lot of employers actually value. When writing your resume, you could even group your experience under broader headings like “Relevant Experience” and “Other Experience,” so the gap doesn’t stand out as much. And if you get an interview, be honest—explain that you used the time for growth and study. Most hiring managers appreciate transparency and resilience more than a perfectly linear work history.

Instead of embellishing dates (which can backfire if they check), I’d recommend including the Whole Foods job with clear dates and maybe a brief explanation in your cover letter or resume summary about the study abroad experience during the gap. Employers appreciate transparency, and showing that you proactively used that time to learn or grow can actually be a positive. Also, don’t underestimate the value of your 5 years at the brewery—that’s solid experience!

Adding a short-term job to your resume can be beneficial in showing that you've been actively seeking employment, but it's essential to be honest about the dates. Embellishing the dates can lead to trouble down the line, especially if the employer conducts a background check. Instead, focus on highlighting your skills and experiences gained during your time at Whole Foods, no matter how short it was. For the gap in your resume, you can explain it in your cover letter or during an interview, mentioning your time abroad studying and how it enriched your personal and professional growth. Remember, honesty is key, and it's better to address the gaps upfront rather than trying to hide them. ... score: 0.37032

Post: [Discussion]: Let's talk about this translations from Russian (modern poet, Olga Popova, translated by Alina Dezent)
May I ask you if these translations sound good for English speaking audience. Thanks!

\*\*\*\*\*

The air vibrates from the chirping of cicadas,

See how polished are their fiddles!

They paganini, and scrub, and shriek,

In the hazy heat, in hazy times.

&#x200B;

They rub their wings off the Parca’s thread,

How they bash out that tune, wild creatures,

The thread can be easily thinned to the end

Once the musicians are in their element.

\*\*\*

here it is, the green-streamed Aegean Sea

most beautiful by the visage and color,

its wild waves beat the rocks with severe blasts,

its streams caress the beach with a warm wave.

&#x200B;

but to play with you, oh sea, is risky,

salty is your brine and it burns like tears,

breaks the flesh and silvers my braids,

swings me on its waves and beckons farther and farther.

&#x200B;

Why is it, oh sea, that I don’t understand you?

I see your waves splashing by the board of the trireme,

I hear your captivating voice - the wind in my ears,

closer is your fierce eye, your beastly roar.

&#x200B;

wine-colored, you swing in a tight embrace

you intoxicate and burn, caress and ruin.

horns on your head, waves full of wailing.

the raving maidens stomp as they dance, their lips in blood and foam.

Reddit author comment: The second to me has something of the crash of the waves against the shore.  I wasn't keen on the format on the first reading but on the second it speaks to me more and I hear it.  I like it, the ebb and flow of it.

For the first one I found myself caught on the capitalization of parka...  Couldn't see why it was done, tried to find a meaning but failed, and that made it hard for me to catch the tone back up.  Is there a reason for the capitalization?  I kind of like the word paganini there, it works for me...  Although it startled me, rather than evokes.  I'm not as familiar with music as I should be, and it brings out what I think that should be rather than what I know, since I can't call to mind any tune. ... score: 0.43392

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: These translations have some beautiful moments but feel inconsistent in their execution. The first poem about cicadas has an intriguing concept - comparing the insects to musicians playing until they literally wear themselves out against fate's thread (the Parca reference). However, there are some awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow for English readers. "They paganini" as a verb is creative but jarring, and "How they bash out that tune" feels too colloquial compared to the more elevated tone elsewhere. The second poem about the Aegean Sea is much stronger overall. The imagery is vivid and the personification of the sea as both seductive and dangerous works well. Lines like "salty is your brine and it burns like tears" and "wine-colored, you swing in a tight embrace" are genuinely beautiful. The progression from attraction to fear to intoxication feels natural. My main critique would be some minor word choices - "visage" feels slightly archaic, and "by the board of the trireme" could be clearer. The translator has captured what seems to be the original's blend of classical imagery with modern sensibility, but the English could be polished to flow more naturally while preserving the poetic intensity. ... score: 0.44693

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I think these translations do a pretty good job of conveying vivid imagery and emotional undertones, but they do feel a bit "foreign" to an English ear—not in a bad way, but in a way that makes you aware it’s translated. For example, lines like "They paganini, and scrub, and shriek," stand out because "Paganini" as a verb is unusual. I get what it’s trying to say (the cicadas play their fiddles with virtuosity), but it feels a little forced. The mythological and nature imagery is strong and evocative, and I like the references to the Parca’s thread and the Aegean Sea. Some lines are beautifully translated, like "the thread can be easily thinned to the end," which is quite poetic. However, some phrases could be polished for smoother English flow, e.g., "the board of the trireme" might read better as "the side of the trireme." Overall, the feeling comes through, but a few tweaks could make the language more natural for English readers while keeping the original’s spirit. ... score: 0.45084

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I think these translations capture a vivid and intense atmosphere, which is really important for poetry like Olga Popova’s. The imagery of cicadas as Paganini-like musicians is quite striking and original, and it translates well into English. However, some phrases feel a bit awkward or overly literal, like “rub their wings off the Parca’s thread” — it might confuse readers unfamiliar with the Parca myth. Also, certain lines could benefit from smoother rhythm or more natural phrasing to flow better in English. Overall, the passion and wildness of the original come through, but a bit more polish could make it resonate even more with English speakers. ... score: 0.43758

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As an English speaker, I found the translation to be quite lyrical and evocative, but there were a few moments where the language felt slightly awkward or overly literal - for example, the phrase "in hazy times" could potentially be rephrased to something like "in a haze of nostalgia" to better capture the poetic essence of the original Russian text, and the use of "Parca's thread" is a bit unclear, as the reference to the Parca may not be immediately familiar to all readers, so it might be helpful to include a footnote or brief explanation to provide context for those who may not be well-versed in mythology, and I also appreciate the way the translator has maintained the musical quality of the original, with phrases like "They paganini, and scrub, and shriek" that have a lively, expressive feel to them, but some of the metaphors, such as the comparison of the sea to a lover, while beautiful, may feel a bit overused or clichéd to some readers, so it's worth considering whether there are other ways to convey the same emotions and ideas in a fresh and unexpected way. ... score: 0.49581

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: 1. I think the translations are quite captivating! The language used is vivid and evocative, creating strong imagery in the reader's mind. The use of metaphors and similes, such as "the chirping of cicadas" being likened to "paganini," and the sea being described as "wine-colored," adds depth and richness to the poems. However, some phrases may be a bit too literal or not entirely idiomatic in English, such as "the thread can be easily thinned to the end," which might sound a bit awkward to an English-speaking audience.

The alliteration in "polished are their fiddles" is a nice touch that adds to the rhythm. The second poem is equally captivating, especially the way it personifies the sea. The contrast between the sea's beauty and its dangerous, almost beastly nature is beautifully conveyed. The line "wine-colored, you swing in a tight embrace" is particularly evocative. I feel like I'm right there, experiencing the sea's fierce embrace. Overall, these translations are a great introduction to Olga Popova's work for an English-speaking audience. ... score: 0.59278

Post: How Do I Progress in Meditation After One Month?
Hey everyone,

I’ve been meditating daily for the past month (10 minutes a day) using Sam Harris’ Waking Up app. I’ve noticed subtle shifts in my perception and awareness, but I feel like I’m at a crossroads.

I know the obvious next step is to increase my meditation time, but beyond that, I don’t have a clear roadmap. I’ve seen posts saying “there’s nowhere to go, you’re already doing it,” and while I get that sentiment, I’d still appreciate some structured guidance on how to deepen my practice.

For those of you who’ve been meditating longer—how did you progress? What helped you move forward? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Reddit author comment: Hi... So i have never used any application or guided meditations....
The only guided thing I have done is YOG NiDRA.

Just narrating my experience with meditation.. please take what resonates and leave what doesn't..


I started sitting by myself.. and did get overwhelmed with the infinite number of thoughts running in my head... I started with just a few minutes... 

I did let all the thoughts come and didn't observe them ... But slowly the frequency and number of thoughts decreased... Now it was a bit possible to observe ..


Slowly the time increased and thoughts decreased...today I can sit for about an hour or let's say 40mins with very less thoughts...
And really good experiences ( which would be different for everyone)

So I would suggest to now ditch the application and see how much self sufficient you are for now... Slowly the next layer will unwrap itself to you...

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Congrats on sticking with it for a month! That's actually huge - most people don't make it past the first week. I've been meditating for about 3 years now, and I remember hitting that exact same crossroads around the one-month mark. Here's what helped me: First, definitely gradually increase your sit time, but do it slowly - maybe add 2-3 minutes every couple weeks until you hit 20-30 minutes. Second, start paying attention to your meditation outside of formal sitting. The real magic happens when you begin catching yourself throughout the day - noticing when you're lost in thought during conversations, or when you're eating mindlessly. I also started reading some dharma books around this time (Wherever You Go There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn was a game changer). The key is consistency over intensity. Don't worry about having profound experiences - those subtle shifts you mentioned are exactly what progress looks like in the beginning. ... score: 0.40444

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Great job sticking with a daily practice! That consistency is honestly the most important foundation. When I was at your stage, I started experimenting with different meditation techniques beyond just mindfulness. For example, I tried loving-kindness (metta) meditations, body scans, and even short open-awareness sessions. Each technique highlighted different aspects of my mind and gave me new insights. I also started reading books like “The Mind Illuminated” for a more structured, step-by-step approach. Over time, it really helped to journal after each session, noting what came up or shifted. You might also consider joining a local or online meditation group; sharing experiences and getting feedback can be surprisingly motivating and illuminating! ... score: 0.55371

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Awesome job on sticking to daily meditation! After a month, I’d say the next step is deepening your curiosity about your experience rather than just increasing time. Try to notice not just what you’re focusing on, but how you relate to distractions, emotions, or discomfort. Sometimes, practicing “noting” — gently labeling thoughts or feelings as they arise — can help develop meta-awareness. Also, exploring complementary practices like mindful movement (yoga, tai chi) or breathwork can enrich your experience.

While it's great that you've been meditating daily for the past month, it's essential to remember that meditation is a journey, not a destination. Instead of increasing your meditation time, try to focus on increasing your mindfulness throughout the day. Pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, and see if you can bring a sense of awareness and curiosity to your daily activities. This will help you cultivate a greater sense of presence and awareness, which will, in turn, deepen your meditation practice. Additionally, consider exploring different types of meditation, such as loving-kindness meditation or transcendental meditation, to see what resonates with you.

Tell me something about your tank(s) that you’ve found yourself really enjoying or has made you happy lately.

I recently changed the stock in my 75 gallon tank. I decided to stock the tank with rainbow fish. I have a group of 7 boesemani’s and 7 turquoise along with 2 blood parrots. I never realized how beautiful rainbow fish are. They are very active and I love watching the colors on them develop.

Post: Fast 911 response!
Yesterday we were having lunch at the food trucks at Burnside and Park when we noticed a young woman near us fall to the ground having a seizure.

I called 911 expecting to be on hold for a long time but the call was answered immediately. The operator was very helpful and had an ambulance on the way in moments. Once we were sure the woman was stabilized and breathing regularly, the 911 operator ended the call. Within anther minute or two we heard the siren and I flagged down the ambulance to be sure they found us quickly.

I just wanted to share a positive story, I've heard lots of anecdotes about people waiting on hold for ages when calling 911. Maybe things were slow yesterday afternoon or something, but they were on it fast!

Also hope the lady who had the seizure is doing OK.

Reddit author comment: Two weeks ago, we (spouse and I) also had a very fast 911 response when assisting an emergency at NE Glisan and NE 57th, right where there is an entrance and exit ramp for I-84. There was a car stalled out blocking both the on- and off-ramps. The occupants were freaking out, screaming, running around the car, and one woman had only one shoe on. It seems like the young man in the car was having an asthma attack, but not sure. One woman called 911 while several of us pushed the car to a safe spot out of traffic.

Post: Trying acrylic for the first time coming from digital painting 
Hi everyone. I'm mainly a digital artist, I love rendering and lately I've been wanting to try traditional medium. A friend of mine recommended acrylic to get a feel of how it works. (I tried watercolor a long time ago but I don't like its style) 

So I got a set on Amazon with 12 colors, and a set of synthetic brushes that came with a plastic round palette that had sections with ridges. I only had cold press watercolor paper so I used that thinking it'd be good enough (actually the paper buckled but that wasn't the problem I'm going to talk about here). 

I find an interesting skull still life and I start playing around with paint. I lay down a half tone wash and start mixing colors.

But as I spend the afternoon painting, I come across these problems:
- a color I mixed was drying on the palette as if I "painted" its surface as I was mixing. So then I try to remember to keep the paint wet with some water, but I mix so much it still does that 
- there's not enough holes on the palette for all the colors I want to mix! I paint in semi realistic style and I need many different values and hues of colors for each local color. I also don't like the holes design of the palette, so I look it up and there's not many options for flat palettes, unless I buy from expensive stores and they seem to be more suited for oil painting (which I think now after researching and watching videos would suit me more). I need to have these colors because I go back and forth around the canvas, and very useful for carving shapes, fixing mistakes etc. 
- acrylic drying not having the same color / value than when it was wet

At this point, I finished an unsatisfying painting and I know you're not supposed to be an expert right off the bat, but I wasn't feeling impressed by the medium and it made me wanting go back to digital. 

So now I have this set I want to use because I paid money for it and I want to figure out how and what went wrong and how I can go about it better prepared, even if it turns out it's not the right medium for me, at least I gave it a shot.

Reddit author comment: Youtube WillKempartschool he has good acrylic painting tutorials and his color mixing videos are also very good. For acrylic painting I use a heavy Fabriano paper , there exists acrylic paint paperpads but it is pricey.
Student quality paints like Daler Rowney, Galleria Winsor & Newton, Liquitex basic, etc usually are reasonably nice to paint with. Paint swatches of all the colors you have, then you see what color it is. If you do layers painting there is dry time and it feels dry, but for a next layer leave overnight to be truly dry.
Make a chart of colors mixes with the colors you have. See youtube video how to paint colorcharts.
The blending of colors, try to blend from single pigment color tubes. Allready mixed from several colors mixed with each other some turn to muddy color.
Traditional painting takes time and patience. Acrylics is fairly easy to learn.
Acrylic paints eat brushes. Clean with soapy water. I prefer synthetic brushes. Never throw away old brushes they give different effects.
Practise and practise.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! Welcome to the traditional painting world - your frustrations are SO common for digital artists making the switch, so don't get discouraged! I went through the exact same thing about three years ago. For the palette issue, ditch that ridged plastic thing immediately - it's terrible for acrylics. Get yourself a large sheet of glass (you can have one cut at a hardware store for like $15) or use a large ceramic plate. The smooth surface makes mixing so much easier and you can scrape dried paint right off. For keeping paint wet longer, invest in a stay-wet palette or make your own with a shallow container, wet paper towels, and parchment paper on top. Game changer! Also, try adding a tiny bit of acrylic medium (like Golden's Open Acrylics medium) to slow drying time. The color shift when drying is just something you learn to compensate for - acrylics typically dry about 10-20% darker, so mix your colors slightly lighter than you think you need. And honestly? Cold press watercolor paper isn't ideal for acrylics - grab some canvas boards or acrylic paper next time. You've got this! ... score: 0.31454

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally relate to your experience! I came to acrylics after years of digital painting, and honestly, it’s a huge adjustment. The palette issue is super common—the little wells are just not enough for mixing lots of subtle hues, especially if you’re used to the flexibility of digital layers and color picking. If you want a cheap flat palette, try a white ceramic dinner plate or even a piece of glass (edges taped for safety). It’ll give you way more room to mix, and cleanup is easy. For paint drying on the palette, some people use a DIY “wet palette”—just a shallow container with a damp sponge and baking paper on top. It keeps acrylics workable for hours. As for the color shift, that’s unfortunately just part of the medium because acrylic binder dries clear, but you’ll get used to predicting it. Maybe try a few smaller studies rather than full pieces, just to get comfortable with the quirks. Good luck—acrylics get a lot more fun once you’re over the initial hurdles! ... score: 0.33224

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey, welcome to the world of acrylics! Transitioning from digital to traditional is definitely a learning curve, so don’t get discouraged. About your palette drying issue, acrylics dry fast because they’re water-based and start polymerizing as soon as they hit air. One trick is to mix smaller amounts more often instead of a large batch that dries on you. You can also try using a stay-wet palette or even a wet palette made with a sponge and palette paper to keep your paints moist longer. Regarding palettes, I totally get the frustration with those plastic ones with holes—they’re not great for mixing lots of colors. I personally use a glass or ceramic flat palette, which is easy to clean and lets you mix freely without the “compartment” limitation. You can find affordable glass palettes online or even repurpose a glass cutting board! Also, about colors drying darker or lighter, acrylics usually dry a bit darker than wet paint, so you might need to take that into account when mixing. Try doing some test swatches to see how colors shift after drying. Keep experimenting; acrylics can be super versatile once you get the hang of them! ... score: 0.38739

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a seasoned traditional artist, I must say that I completely understand your frustration with acrylics, especially when coming from a digital background where you're used to having total control over every aspect of your artwork. I think the first thing you should consider is investing in a better palette, one that's specifically designed for acrylics and has a non-stick surface, this will help prevent the paint from drying out and make mixing colors a lot easier. I also recommend using a spray bottle to keep your paints moist, this way you can focus on your artwork without worrying about the paint drying out. Another thing to keep in mind is that acrylics are a fast-drying medium, so you need to work quickly, but this can also be an advantage, as it allows you to build up layers and textures quickly. As for the color shift, this is a common issue with acrylics, but you can minimize it by using a high-quality paint that's specifically designed to have minimal color shift. I would also recommend watching some tutorials and videos on acrylic painting, as this will give you a better understanding of how to work with the medium and how to achieve the effects you want. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself, it's okay to make mistakes and it's all part of the learning process, and who knows, you might just find that you love working with acrylics once you get the hang of it. ... score: 0.35217

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Regarding your first issue, acrylics do dry quite quickly, which can be both a blessing and a curse. To prevent your paints from drying out while you're still mixing, you might want to try using a stay-wet palette or even just placing a damp paper towel over your palette when you're not using it. This can help keep your paints workable for a longer period of time. ... score: 0.42135

It’s basically a palette with a damp sponge and a piece of special paper that keeps your paints wet for longer. They’re not too expensive and can be a game changer. As for the mixing, I recommend getting a larger, flat palette. You can even use a plastic plate or a piece of glass if you’re on a budget. This will give you more space to mix colors without running out of room. Another tip is to mix a bit more paint than you think you’ll need, so you don’t run out halfway through. Lastly, the color shift when acrylics dry is a bit of a learning curve, but it gets easier with practice. You can also use a medium or gel to slow down the drying process and help maintain the color. Don’t give up yet! It’s normal to feel a bit overwhelmed at first, but with some adjustments, you might find acrylics to be a rewarding medium. ... score: 0.39799

Post: Has anyone here mourned losing their favorite hobby to a permanent ankle injury?
Long story short, I have ligament and cartilage issues in my right ankle. I've had surgery, years of PT, boots, injections, diet changes, foot wear changes, lost weight, gained muscle, taped, RICEd, gave up running, took supplements, bought a red light therapy panel.

3. Consider if you need separate pages for about me, and contact me. Your homepage's content is quite sparse, including about me (since it's also a pretty short section) and contact me can possibly flow better. 

In terms of rating I'd give it a 9/10. Once again, your portfolio is already quite professional if you're having doubts I think making small adjustments to it over time would be best.

Post: Trauma based therapy - EMDR
Hi - I’m in the process of starting trauma based therapy. I am autistic and have a bunch of comorbidities including cPTSD. 

Has anyone gone through EMDR? How was your experience? Do you think it’s effective or should I consider something like CBT?

Reddit author comment: Hello. I’m also autistic. 45f with CPTSD. I did lots of EMDR and I found it especially helpful for diffusing the potency of a few extremely traumatic moments in my life. It turned down the volume of my reactivity to those specific memories and I’m grateful to have gone through the process. It’s definitely worth trying and you’ll likely know after a couple sessions if it’s right for you. 

Last year I underwent Ketamine therapy. Doses were administered by a psychiatric nurse practitioner. I completed 6 sessions over the course of 6 weeks (each experience lasting about an hour). Ketamine therapy helped me gain insight and shift my perspective in a variety of helpful ways. It felt more like a 6-part spiritual experience than a medical treatment. Wild, weird and wonderful. 

I wish you all the best in your healing. ... score: 0.45448

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've done EMDR for my cPTSD and it was honestly life-changing, but I want to be real with you about the process. As someone who's also neurodivergent (ADHD), I found that the bilateral stimulation actually worked really well for me - sometimes better than the traditional eye movements. My therapist let me use tactile stimulators (little buzzers you hold) instead when the eye tracking felt overwhelming. The thing about EMDR is that it can bring up a lot of intense emotions and memories initially, so make sure you have good coping strategies in place and a therapist who understands autism. It took about 6 months of weekly sessions before I really started noticing significant changes, but when it clicked, it REALLY clicked. My hypervigilance decreased dramatically and I stopped having those intense flashback episodes. CBT is great for learning skills, but EMDR actually helped process the trauma at a deeper level. Just make sure your therapist is trained in both EMDR and has experience with autistic clients - that combination is crucial. ... score: 0.36795

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I went through EMDR about two years ago for my own childhood trauma and PTSD, and I’m also autistic. Honestly, it was life-changing for me, but it definitely wasn’t easy. The first few sessions were intense and brought up a lot of emotions I didn’t realize I was still holding onto. My therapist was great about pacing things and making sure I had grounding techniques to use if things got overwhelming. What I liked about EMDR was that it didn’t require me to talk in detail about my trauma, which I found especially helpful as communication can be tricky for me sometimes. I still use some CBT strategies alongside EMDR, but EMDR helped me process things on a deeper level. If you have a therapist who understands both autism and trauma, I’d say it’s worth trying, but make sure to advocate for your needs throughout the process. ... score: 0.44344

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I’ve been through EMDR therapy for about six months now, and while everyone’s experience is unique, I found it to be quite effective for processing past trauma. As someone who also has cPTSD, the bilateral stimulation (like eye movements or tapping) initially felt strange, but over time it helped me access and reframe some deeply buried memories in a way that traditional talk therapy hadn’t. That said, EMDR can be intense, so it’s important to have a therapist who understands your specific needs, especially with autism in the mix. I’d say it’s worth trying if you feel open to it, but CBT can also be a solid option for managing symptoms and building coping strategies alongside trauma work. ... score: 0.38731

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've gone through EMDR and I can attest that it's been a lifesaver for me, especially in managing my cPTSD symptoms. As someone who's also autistic, I was a bit apprehensive at first, worried that the therapy wouldn't be tailored to my needs, but my therapist was amazing and made sure to adapt the approach to suit me. The thing with EMDR is that it can be quite intense, so it's essential to have a therapist who's experienced in working with autistic clients and those with trauma. For me, the most significant benefit of EMDR was the reduction in flashbacks and nightmares - it was like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I also noticed an improvement in my emotional regulation, which was a game-changer. I'd definitely recommend giving it a try, but make sure to do your research and find a therapist who's a good fit for you. It's also crucial to remember that everyone's experience with EMDR is different, and it might take some time to see the benefits, but with the right support, it can be incredibly effective. ... score: 0.42703

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Absolutely, I’ve been through EMDR, and it was a transformative experience for me. Initially, I was skeptical because I've tried so many different therapies over the years, and nothing seemed to make a lasting impact. However, EMDR was different. The bilateral stimulation really helped me process some deeply ingrained traumas that I thought I’d never be able to fully address. It’s not a quick fix; it took several sessions to really see the benefits, but the changes were profound. I felt a significant reduction in anxiety and a better ability to manage my triggers. It’s important to have a therapist who is experienced and can guide you through the process, especially with your comorbidities. EMDR can be intense, so make sure you have good support and self-care in place. I would definitely recommend giving it a try, but also consider having a backup plan, like CBT, if you feel it’s not working for you. Everyone’s journey is unique, and what works for one person might not work for another. Good luck, and I hope you find the right path for you! ... score: 0.4975

Post: (Update) Recognize these guys? They came home with me yesterday
I learned about these guys through this subreddit and fell in love. Apparently they had been in foster care almost their entire lives. I'm so excited to get to know them more. They're already warming up to me (I got a stern thump when I pet them the first time, but they're starting to come up to me and they let me pet them a lot now).

Tell me your rabbit's favorite food, I'm figuring out what they like! My first rabbits went mad for bananas, so I had those as treats/bribes for their first evening, but these two are completely ambivalent!

Reddit author comment: I remember this post! I have 4 buns who live the high life, but I still tried to talk my partner into adopting them. I’m so glad they got a good home!! 🖤 

My rabbits go absolutely ham for carrot greens. If you’re in a space that you can plant carrots, they will flower, they will go to seed, and they will litter your entire space with more carrots. We walk out back and pluck a handful of carrots, give them a little carrot each, and then make them a pile of the greens. They love it and carrots are so self maintaining once planted, it’s a perfect system.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh my goodness, congratulations on your new bunnies! The fact that they're already coming up to you and letting you pet them is such a great sign - rabbits can be so cautious at first, especially ones who have been in foster care for a while. That initial thump was probably just them saying "hey, who are you?!" but it sounds like they're quickly realizing you're their new favorite human. As for favorite foods, my Holland Lop absolutely goes CRAZY for fresh cilantro - like, she'll literally do backflips when she hears me rustling the cilantro bag. She also loves apple slices (just a small piece as a treat), and surprisingly, she's obsessed with the leafy tops of carrots more than the actual carrot itself. Some other hits in my house are small pieces of strawberry, fresh parsley, and romaine lettuce.

As for favorite foods, Luna absolutely loves fresh veggies like carrots, bell peppers, and cucumbers. She's particularly fond of timothy hay, which I make sure to provide in abundance. I've also found that rabbits have different preferences when it comes to fruits, so it's not surprising that your new friends aren't too keen on bananas. Perhaps you could try introducing them to other fruits like apples, berries, or even melons? Remember to always introduce new foods gradually and in small amounts to prevent digestive upset.

Post: Separation anxiety training
We recently adopted a 7 month old English Cocker Spaniel cross. She's very intelligent and sweet, but came from a neglected background and was abandoned at the foster where we got her from. I've been with her at home for the last 2 weeks and she's settled in really well, bonded to my partner and I, sleeps through the night, accidents in the house/puppy pad use has dropped almost entirely, eats well, goes on walks. She's a little skittish and nervous around new people, but she's come along way even in the \~2.5 weeks we've had her.

On Monday, I tried going in to the office for the first time. We have baby cameras in the house to monitor her. When I checked on her about 30 minutes after I left, I could hear she was vocalising a lot and she had torn up the puppy pad we had left down for her. I came home after about 3 hours from leaving. She stopped vocalising around the hour and a half mark, and she was just sleeping on the bed afterward. When I got home, she wasn't visibly excited or racing to come greet me, just lying on the bed and her head perked up to look at me. Both my partner and I don't make a big fuss about leaving and returning from work, a calm acknowledgment when she's settled.

Since then, I've been doing some desensitisation training on me leaving the house to help with the separation anxiety behaviour. I'll "get ready to leave", put her behind the puppy gate, and call out "I'll be back", and then stand outside the front door and monitor her on the camera. Initially, I came back in when I could see her on the bed sitting or lying down and not scratching at the gate or vocalising and give her a high value treat, calmy telling her she's a good girl, and repeating the process. We've been repeating this training over 40ish minute blocks since Tuesday, and she's quickly picked up that being on the bed calmly gets her a reward. If she jumps down to run to the gate when I come back in, I turn around and start again. She also has a Kong toy she only gets when we go out.

She'll jump up and down off the bed a couple times looking for us, vocalise and scratch at the gate, but she will always get back on the bed and sit/lie down calmly after doing so. I've pushed this to about 5-7 minutes, mindful to not go too long too quickly.

Is there anything else I should be doing to help reinforce the behaviour, or at this point is the consistency the key?

Reddit author comment: Sounds like you are doing everything right! Consistency is key. Also acknowledge that it can take 3+ months for a dog to settle in and get used to a routine. She’s also about to go through a fear period and almost a teenager (yikes) so if you have setbacks it doesn’t necessarily mean you are doing something wrong, they just tend to take 2 steps forward 1 step back at this age.

As someone who went through this exact same situation with my rescue pup, I can tell you that consistency is definitely the key here, and it sounds like you're already seeing great progress. The fact that she's learned that being calm on the bed gets rewarded shows how smart she is and how well your training approach is working. One thing I'd suggest adding is gradually increasing the unpredictability of your departures - sometimes leave for 2 minutes, sometimes 6, sometimes 4, so she doesn't start anticipating exactly when you'll return. Also, consider adding some mental stimulation toys beyond just the Kong - puzzle feeders or snuffle mats can help keep her brain occupied and make alone time more positive. Given her background of neglect and abandonment, you're being incredibly thoughtful about taking this slowly. The progress you've described in just a few days is honestly impressive.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: It sounds like you’re doing a really fantastic job with your pup so far! Separation anxiety can be tough to manage, especially with a dog who’s had a rough start in life. Consistency is definitely key, but you might also want to consider varying your departure cues a bit so she doesn’t get too accustomed to a specific routine—sometimes dogs can start associating certain actions (like picking up keys or putting on shoes) with you leaving, which can trigger anxiety. Also, try mixing up the time you’re gone, sometimes shorter, sometimes a little longer, but always within her comfort zone. Interactive toys like puzzle feeders or treat-dispensing balls can help too, so she has more to focus on than just your absence. Finally, if you haven’t already, try to make sure she’s had some physical exercise and mental stimulation before you leave—tired dogs are generally less anxious.

Consistency is definitely key here, but patience is just as important; it can take weeks or even months to fully overcome separation anxiety.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: It's wonderful that you're taking proactive steps to address your dog's separation anxiety, and it's even more impressive that you've seen significant progress in just a few days of desensitization training. One thing you might consider adding to your training is a "departure cue" - a specific action or phrase that signals to your dog that you're leaving, which can help her prepare and reduce anxiety. This could be something as simple as putting on your jacket or grabbing your keys, and using a specific phrase like "I'm going out" or "see you later." By associating this cue with your departure, you can help your dog learn to anticipate and cope with your leaving. Additionally, you might consider increasing the duration of your departures gradually, but also randomly, to simulate the unpredictability of real-life situations. For example, you could start with shorter departures, like 5-10 minutes, and then increase the duration to 30 minutes, but also throw in some shorter departures to keep your dog on her toes. ... score: 0.46128

It's amazing how far she's come in such a short time, especially given her background. The desensitization training you're doing is spot-on for helping her with separation anxiety. I would suggest adding some classical conditioning to the mix as well. You can start by pairing your leaving with something really positive, like her favorite treat or a long-lasting chew toy. This can help her associate your departure with good things, not just the absence of you. You might also try leaving the house for very short periods initially, like 30 seconds, and gradually increasing the time as she becomes more comfortable. It's great that you're using a Kong toy as a distraction, but you could also try giving her a frozen Kong or a food puzzle toy to keep her engaged and mentally stimulated while you're away. Consistency is definitely key, but these small adjustments can help reinforce the positive behavior even more.

Post: Have you ever dreamt of conducting an experiment with no limits? 
Do you have a wild theory that breaks the boundaries of conventional thinking?   
  
There's a conference in October that is inviting folks to share their boldest ideas. It's called *Extreme Experiments & Unhinged Hypotheses*—a lightning round of 5-minute talks where imagination reigns supreme. 

The conference is appropriately named the Zombie Apocalypse Medicine Meeting (ZAMM), and looks to share complex topics about the future of humanity...but through the lens of the zombie apocalypse, as the name suggests. It's imaginative and radically interdisciplinary bridging science and the arts to grapple with the most pressing challenges of the present and the future. This year's meeting focuses on the ways humans manage apocalyptic risks, especially through cooperation, storytelling, entertainment and play, and I can't help but imagine incorporating these ideas into our theories about the future. The goal of ZAMM, as stated on the website, is to reduce the global burden of zombification and contribute to apocalypse prevention and preparedness through interdisciplinary engagement.  
  
While we might not all show up at this conference (though it would fascinating if we had a reddit takeover at this event, with wild theories flying around) I'm curious-- If you had a chance to present radical, out-of-the-box research designs, speculative theories, or experimental frameworks that defy constraints, what would you be interested in talk about? It could be a study too ambitious to fund, a concept so daring it might just work, a theory on the cutting edge of science fiction...what would you talk about?

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This sounds absolutely fascinating! I've always been obsessed with the idea of conducting a massive longitudinal study on collective human behavior during resource scarcity - something that would obviously be completely unethical to actually implement, but perfect for a zombie apocalypse framework. My wild theory is that humans actually have an untapped "hive mind" capability that only emerges during extreme crisis situations, similar to how certain ant colonies can make complex decisions without centralized leadership. I'd want to design an experiment that tests whether isolated groups of survivors would independently develop similar survival strategies, communication methods, and social hierarchies when faced with identical zombie threats. The study would involve creating controlled "apocalypse scenarios" with different variables - urban vs rural settings, different group sizes, varying resource availability - and then tracking how quickly groups develop cooperative behaviors, leadership structures, and innovative solutions. I think we'd discover that humans have dormant collective intelligence mechanisms that our modern society has actually suppressed.

Using storytelling, VR simulations, and collaborative world-building games, we could test whether exposure to fictional apocalypses (zombies or otherwise) helps people build cognitive resilience, critical thinking, and collective coping mechanisms for real-world crises. The experiment would involve tracking participants over time, seeing if their reactions to disinformation campaigns, panic-inducing news, or conspiracy theories are more measured after a "memetic vaccine." It would blend psychology, media studies, immunology (in a metaphorical sense), and even a bit of improv theater.

For instance, an AI system could predict zombie movements, optimize resource allocation, and even help in the development of a cure. The experiment would involve creating a small, wearable device that can interface with the brain, allowing for real-time data exchange and decision-making support. The ethical implications would be vast, but the potential benefits in terms of human resilience and adaptability could be monumental. Plus, it would be a fascinating way to explore how we can use technology to enhance our survival in extreme scenarios, while also pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human in a post-apocalyptic world. I think this kind of research could not only be a game-changer for ZAMM but also spark new discussions in the broader scientific community about the future of AI and human collaboration. I'd love to hear what others think about this idea and any feedback on the feasibility or ethical considerations! ... score: 0.42849
