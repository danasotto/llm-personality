Post: Last classes were today and students added me on social media
Today was the last day of classes and 2 of my favorite students requested to follow me on Instagram. Completely great and mature kids and I want to accept the requests, but I feel like the smart move is to wait till they graduate (they just finished 9th grade). Any advice on how to handle this? This is my first year of teaching and haven't handled this so far. 

Reddit author comment: You could take my approach and just not have social media. I've gotten rid of my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, and can't say my life is noticeably worse for having done so; Facebook is nice to find out what happened to the people wmyoi went to high school with, but then you eventually realize why you weren't friends with everyone, anyway. Plus, these companies make money on any data you give them, data which compromises your personal privacy, lets companies engage in differential pricing and marketing, and has the power to sway elections (at least, if we believe the social research that's trickling out, now).

So, to my mind, the easiest answer to them asking is "I don't have it, here's why," because you not only answer the question in a way they can't wheedle in, but start a conversation about an important issue they probably never thought of.

I might give out my email address, if they're seniors, but that's it. ... score: 0.16939

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Honestly, your instinct to wait is spot on. I've been teaching for 8 years now and this comes up every semester. Even with your absolute favorite, most mature students, it's just better to maintain that professional boundary while they're still enrolled at your school. Social media can get messy - you might see posts about parties, drama between students, or even just typical teenage stuff that could put you in an awkward position later. What I usually do is tell students something like "I'd love to connect after you graduate! Hit me up then and we can follow each other." Most kids totally understand and respect that boundary. The mature ones especially get it. Plus, if admin ever questions your social media connections with current students, you don't want to have to explain yourself even if your intentions are completely innocent. Wait until graduation - it shows professionalism and protects both you and them. ... score: 0.33779

gpt4.1-instruct comment: As a fellow teacher, I totally get where you’re coming from! It feels really flattering when students want to connect with you outside of school, especially the ones you’ve built a good rapport with. However, I would strongly recommend holding off on accepting their requests until after they graduate. Even if they’re mature, there are still professional boundaries to consider, and school policies (and parents!) can get really particular about this kind of thing. What I usually do is politely let students know that I don’t accept current students on my personal social media, but once they graduate, I’d be happy to connect. This keeps things professional and sets a good example. Plus, you never know what might happen in the future, so it’s best to err on the side of caution. Great job making it through your first year! ... score: 0.39377

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Honestly, I think you’re right to be cautious here. It’s always a tricky line between being approachable and maintaining professional boundaries, especially as a teacher. Accepting social media requests from current students can sometimes blur those lines and might lead to uncomfortable situations down the road. Waiting until they graduate is a good move because it helps keep your relationship strictly professional while they’re still under your authority. In the meantime, you can always keep the connection positive in class and encourage them to reach out through school channels if they ever need help. Once they’ve graduated, if you’re comfortable, accepting the follow requests can be a nice way to keep in touch without the complications. It’s great that you’re thinking about this so carefully—setting clear boundaries early on will serve you well throughout your career. ... score: 0.34826

It’s a delicate balance, but maintaining boundaries is crucial, especially with younger students.

Reddit author comment: Answer: [Hindenburg Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindenburg_Research) was in investment research firm that set out to make money from exposing companies that were engaged in fraud and wrongdoing. Hindenburg would find a company that it thought was a scam and prepare a detailed report with evidence of what they were doing wrong. Hindenburg and its partners would then buy "short positions" in the company's stock, which bets that the stock price will go down. Hindenburg then released the report, which would usually cause the company's stock to crash since people would now know it was a scam. This was often followed by government investigations and criminal charges for the companies Hindenburg identified.

One of the companies targeted by Hindenburg Research was [the Adani Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adani_Group#Stock_manipulation_and_accounting_fraud_allegations) from India. This company is closely connected to the ruling party in India and the allegations were highly embarrassing to them, so they have been retaliating against Hindenburg and people and firms linked to it. [Due to its political slant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organiser_\(magazine\)), that website is trying to question the motives of Hindenburg and linked people and firms.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is a pretty complex situation that's been unfolding over the past few weeks. From what I've gathered, there are allegations that Hindenburg Research, which made those explosive claims about the Adani Group last year, may have had undisclosed financial relationships with Anson Funds and potentially coordinated their research with political figures. The article you linked suggests there was some kind of collusion between Hindenburg and these other parties, which would be a massive conflict of interest if true. What's particularly concerning is the implication that what was presented as independent financial research may have actually been part of a coordinated campaign. However, I'd take this with a grain of salt since the source appears to have a particular political leaning. We should wait for more mainstream financial media to investigate these claims thoroughly. The allegations about TMC's Mahua Moitra are also serious if substantiated, as they suggest potential coordination between foreign short-sellers and Indian political figures.

The article you linked suggests there’s evidence of collusion, and it even ties in political figures like Mahua Moitra from TMC, which only adds more layers to the story. If these allegations prove true, it could seriously undermine Hindenburg’s credibility and raise questions about the ethics of activist short-sellers.

Post: Is Naofumi trying to make everyone hate him and if so why? (The Rising of the Shield Hero)
Hi all, I just finished episode 8 and in that episode Raphtalia asked if Naofumi was trying to make everyone hate him. I might've forgotten something but is that true and what would the point be or is he actually just kinda mean?

Reddit author comment: I only read the webnovel, and the anime is based off of the light novels which almost completely diverge after book 2, but I'm pretty sure they're the same in season 1 so the answer I remember is 'No'. He's not trying to get people to hate him. He just doesn't care what people think about him because he assumes they already hate him or would otherwise treat him poorly/exploit him.

But I read this like a decade ago, so I might not remember the nuances.

Yeah Naofumi is kinda mean but it's a result of his immense ptsd/depression. Idk if they conveyed that clearly in the anime but in the webnovel it's pretty clear. iirc he can't even taste anymore ever since his trauma. ... score: 0.18934

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yeah, Naofumi is definitely putting up walls and pushing people away, but it's not because he's naturally mean - it's a trauma response from being falsely accused and betrayed so early on. Think about it: he was summoned to save the world, immediately framed for rape, stripped of his money and reputation, and abandoned by literally everyone except slave traders. That kind of betrayal would mess anyone up psychologically. He's adopted this cynical, abrasive persona as a defense mechanism because if he expects the worst from people and keeps them at arm's length, he can't be hurt again. It's easier to be the "bad guy" than to risk opening up and getting stabbed in the back again. Raphtalia sees through this facade because she's been with him long enough to witness his genuine kindness beneath the bitter exterior. He saved her, cared for her when she was sick, and protected her despite claiming he only sees her as a tool. The guy is clearly hurting and using meanness as armor. ... score: 0.24393

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a great question and a pretty central theme to Naofumi’s character, especially in the early part of the show. It’s not that Naofumi is *trying* to make everyone hate him, but after being falsely accused and seeing how the kingdom immediately turned on him, he’s basically given up on trying to win people over. He adopts this “lone wolf” persona as a defense mechanism because he feels like he can’t trust anyone except Raphtalia. So, when he acts cold or indifferent, it’s more about protecting himself from further betrayal. It might look like he’s purposely pushing people away, but it’s really just a reaction to the trauma and injustice he’s faced. Over time, you’ll see that his attitude starts to change as he slowly rebuilds trust, mostly thanks to Raphtalia and others who genuinely care about him. ... score: 0.21524

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I don’t think Naofumi is actively trying to make everyone hate him, but given the circumstances he’s in, it kind of comes off that way sometimes. Remember, he was falsely accused and betrayed right at the start, so he’s naturally guarded and defensive. He’s not mean for the sake of being mean; it’s more like self-preservation and mistrust. He’s been forced into a corner where he can’t rely on others, so his bluntness and sometimes cold attitude are a way to protect himself from further harm. Raphtalia’s question might be more about how his behavior appears to others rather than his true intentions. Naofumi’s actions are shaped by trauma, and while he might not be the most socially graceful hero, he’s genuinely trying to survive and get stronger to protect those who trust him. So, no, he’s not trying to make everyone hate him—he just hasn’t had much of a chance to show his good side yet. ... score: 0.20325

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think Naofumi is trying to make everyone hate him, at least to some extent. I believe he's doing this as a form of self-protection, given the betrayal and abuse he suffered at the hands of Malty and the rest of the nobles. It's like he's putting up walls around himself, making it difficult for others to get close, so he doesn't get hurt again. This behavior could also be a result of his past experiences, where being nice and trusting led to him being taken advantage of. By being perceived as mean or standoffish, Naofumi may be trying to deter people from getting too close, thus avoiding the risk of being betrayed or hurt once more. Moreover, his actions could be a cry for help, a desperate attempt to get someone to notice him and understand his pain, even if it's through negative attention. It's also possible that Naofumi is struggling with feelings of guilt and shame, stemming from the false accusations and his subsequent treatment, which could be contributing to his behavior. Overall, I think Naofumi's actions are complex and multifaceted, driven by a mix of self-protection, past trauma, and a deep-seated need for connection and understanding. ... score: 0.24643

Naofumi's been through a lot, and his harsh behavior is a defensive mechanism. He doesn't want to open himself up to further hurt, so he pushes others away.

Post: Roddick Agreeing with Opelka about doubles
So this was from the lastest podcast episode of Roddick's Served Podcast. I have to say Roddick's general attitude regarding doubles is a bit over the top. I dont know what his problem is regardless of it making money or not but he just comes off as belittling doubles players and acting like how Opelka says that they are failed singles players.

Roddick in his podcasts tends to just shit on doubles to no end. For him its just a money suck. Even with that nice feel good win of patten and heliovaara he went and shit on it. Even i the recent podcast he keeps harping on doubles being a money suck when I genuinely dont see it. He also seems to hate the fact that doubles specialists exists and also agrees with Reilly that doubles players are just failed singles players or ones who never tried at singles. (Also as aside note love how he's fine with all the shit that Reilly posts cause 'he's just being himself' but needs to find a way to critique other players who post shit on social media

Roddick in this podcast episode really has me turning off from him cause of the way he is talking. Watching it today it was just like "if you dont agree with me then your just an emotional loser who doesnt understand the realities of money and life'. But like doubles has been here for a while it makes money when the tournaments promote it properly IMO. Heliovaara and Patten winning was such a nice thing imo given the sturggle they had to make it into tennis. Maybe Roddick's been blessed in that he's never had that issue of financial struggle and its clearly showing especially wiht the Bopanna comments.

Overall very preachy and over the top.

EDIT: He's really doubling down on it with short he released pretty much saying anyone who disagrees with him is just being emotional. What i am seeing is just a retired player using a podcast as is little soapbox and not actually providing any value here. For all the facts he says he actually hasnt provided any aside from Doubles has been here for a while. He hasnt said how much the tours or slams spend to promote doubles.

Reddit author comment: None of them explained why they don’t want double specialists, just that they don’t. Apparently a player said they have no problem with Bopanna, just that they don’t want another one, why? It just screams jealousy. The singles players complain about scheduling enough, now they’re all gonna start playing doubles? Give me a break.

Something I don’t really ever see considered is the cost to go watch tennis, I was looking recently at tickets for Turin, Stuttgart and Vienna, Turin was at least €200 for half a day of the first RR, Vienna was €100 for some R1 seats and Stuttgart was about €130 for a weekend grounds pass. It’s insane, I got day 1 centre court Wimbledon tickets last year for £70, but tour events charge more, so if people are just attending one event a year that’s cost a lot they probably do want to see a big name they know and can tell people about.

Like, does he not realize that some of the greatest tennis minds in history were doubles specialists? The Bryan Brothers revolutionized the game and brought so much excitement to doubles tennis. And the argument that they're "failed singles players" is just lazy analysis. Some players genuinely prefer the strategy and teamwork aspect of doubles - it's a completely different skill set.

Doubles brings a different set of skills to the table—reflexes, teamwork, strategy—that singles simply doesn't highlight in the same way. And for a lot of fans, the excitement and unpredictability of doubles is a huge draw. I also think it’s unfair to call doubles players “failed singles players”; some people just excel in a different discipline, and that should be celebrated, not mocked.

What do you think?

Reddit author comment: "Project Blue Beam" is a conspiracy fiction book published in 1994. What it describes is a False Flag Gaslight technique used by the government to polarize the population.

9/11 was the first use of this Republican Dirty Trick. Bin Laden was a CIA trained operative and a Sunni Islam Saudi Arabian. All 19 of the hijackers were Sunni Islam Arabs, most Saudi Arabian. It had to be an inside job because there was too much inside information about which planes would have full fuel tanks, when they were scheduled to be in the air, what their routes were. It was too precise for it to not have been a CIA planned operation.

In 2003, Republican President George W. Bush used this technique again, a False Flag Gaslighting of the American public on the "grave threat to national security" of Aluminum Tubes and Yellow Cake, lying to the United Nations about their "threat". Dave Chappelle could see through that BS back then.

Post: Villains/antagonists that win?
villains/antagonists that win?

Hi there, I’m a YouTuber who makes essays on writing advice that I make up. I’m doing a series on villains and need help finding examples. Here’s the idea:

These antagonists force the protagonist to make a lose-lose decision with no clear answer. 

The examples I have so far include the joker, Amy dunne, and Thanos. Any help would be greatly appreciated 🙏 

Reddit author comment: I'm astonished that Ozymandias is not the first name there. And I don't even see anyone having mentioned him yet.

So, Ozymandias from Watchmen. He's the best example of this by a mile. He lays out a plan, executes it, and by the time the heroes come to foil him he curtly informs them that the whole plan has been executed 35 mins ago and that there was no way he was going to let them get a chance at stopping him. Iconic scene, poking fun at the very trope of the hero saving the day in the last minute while the villain is monologuing. ... score: 0.21205

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, this is such a fascinating topic! One that immediately comes to mind is Anton Chigurh from "No Country for Old Men." That dude is absolutely terrifying because he operates on this twisted sense of fate and inevitability. Llewelyn Moss is basically screwed from the moment he takes that money - every choice he makes just leads to more death and destruction. He can try to run, but Chigurh will find him. He can try to fight, but innocent people die. He can try to give the money back, but it's too late for that. Chigurh wins because he's not just a killer, he's like this force of nature that represents the chaos and randomness of the universe. The protagonist literally cannot win against him because you can't defeat fate itself. The coin flip scenes are just *chef's kiss* - pure psychological horror where the victim has to participate in their own potential doom. Chigurh gets what he wants and walks away, barely even injured, while everyone else is dead or broken. ... score: 0.19809

gpt4.1-instruct comment: One great example is Ozymandias from "Watchmen." His whole plan is essentially to put the entire world in a no-win scenario: he orchestrates a catastrophic event to unite humanity against a common enemy, sacrificing millions to save billions. The protagonists do confront him, but by the time they realize what he’s done, it’s too late—his plan has already succeeded. They're left with the moral dilemma of whether to expose the truth and possibly undo world peace or to keep silent and live with the consequences. Ozymandias forces them into a lose-lose scenario where neither option feels right, and in the end, he arguably "wins" because his vision is realized. ... score: 0.2308

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: One villain that really stands out to me in terms of forcing no-win decisions is Light Yagami from *Death Note*. Throughout the series, Light creates this impossible moral dilemma for the people around him and the audience alike—do you side with his vision of justice, which involves mass murder, or do you oppose him and risk allowing crime to flourish? The protagonist, L, is constantly put in positions where every move seems to lead to bigger sacrifices or losses. Light’s "win" isn’t just about defeating his enemies but reshaping society in a way that forces everyone to question their own ethical boundaries. Definitely a complex antagonist who wins by forcing lose-lose scenarios. ... score: 0.21495

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think the most compelling aspect of your request is the idea of villains forcing the protagonist into a lose-lose situation, as it highlights the complexity and nuance of their characters. The Joker, Amy Dunne, and Thanos are indeed excellent examples of this trope, as they each present a formidable challenge to their respective protagonists. The Joker's chaotic nature and lack of motivation beyond causing anarchy makes him a particularly interesting case, as his actions are unpredictable and seemingly devoid of rationality, thereby forcing Batman to question his own morality and the true nature of justice. Amy Dunne, on the other hand, is a master manipulator who uses her intelligence and charm to toy with Nick and the audience, making it difficult to discern her true intentions and creating a sense of unease and tension. Thanos, with his twisted sense of purpose and conviction, raises important questions about the balance between resources and population, and the morality of sacrificing some for the greater good. In terms of other examples, I would suggest looking into characters like Nurse Ratched from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, who exerted total control over the psychiatric hospital and forced the patients to conform to her strict rules, or Colonel Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds, who was a ruthless and cunning Nazi officer with a talent for manipulation and detection. Both of these characters present a formidable challenge to their protagonists and force them to make difficult choices in order to survive. ... score: 0.2567

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: 1. Hey! I think you might find some interesting examples from literature as well. For instance, in William Golding's "Lord of the Flies," the antagonist is the inherent evil within human nature, which ultimately triumphs over the protagonists' attempts to maintain order and civilization. In Fyodor Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment," the antagonist, Svidrigailov, is a morally corrupt man who, despite his death, succeeds in manipulating the protagonist, Raskolnikov, into questioning his own morality and sanity. These characters force the protagonists into lose-lose situations and challenge their core beliefs. Good luck with your series! ... score: 0.35513

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I love this topic! It's so interesting to see how villains can shape the narrative in such a powerful way. One example that comes to mind is Tom Riddle (Voldemort) from the Harry Potter series. While Voldemort doesn’t win in the traditional sense, he forces Harry to make a series of difficult decisions, particularly in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows." The most significant one is when Harry realizes he must sacrifice himself to break Voldemort’s hold on the Horcruxes. This lose-lose decision ultimately leads to Harry’s near-death experience and sets the stage for the final battle. Another example is Hannibal Lecter from "The Silence of the Lambs." While he doesn’t directly win, he manipulates Clarice Starling into making a series of choices that ultimately lead to her emotional and psychological turmoil. Both these villains force their protagonists into situations where there’s no clear right answer, making them compelling antagonists. ... score: 0.26975

Post: backdoor in ballot scanner?
Hello, I'm looking for expert input regarding a set of discovery documents I am creating.   I am in discovery regarding a 2020 election related complaint, and I have the opportunity to do a forensic examination of a new ballot scanning machine that was gifted to my County in 2020 as part of the so called Zuckerbucks grants.

I suspect that a backdoor could be in place on the new equipment to allow the raw ballot information to be copied off.         Having the raw ballot information would allow one party to target voters with online voter turnout programs, such as Activote, which claims to be able to increase a targeted voter's probability of voting  in the primaries by 30%.
   Ballot confidentiality may have already been compromised with the existing in person  voting systems. 

I am creating set of interrogatories and demands and I would appreciate any input.

The incoming vbm ballots are scanned daily  by the machine on page 37,
https://www.kanecountyil.gov/Lists/Events/Attachments/6253/Election%20Security%20Presentation.pdf
then my undestanding is the scanned images are stored on an "MBB" (some kind of hard drive),  and then there is a tabulation machine that is run on election night that tabulates all of the races.

demands:

1; make, model, and serial number of machine on pg 37 (ballot scanner)

2  make, model, and technical details of MBB devices

3. make, model, serial number of tabulation machine

4  software release numbers for scanner and tabulator.

5.  How often are software updates performed on machines?

6.  Do backups exist of the systems prior to any software updates.


If anyone can make further suggestions please do.    They specifically state that the tabulator is not connected to the internet.   I think the first place the data could be stolen is the scanner.    I expect to get physical access to the machine as part of discovery.   If I can I want to take pictures of the circuit boards to ID the chipsets.   thanks, -pc1

Reddit author comment: "I have the opportunity to do a forensic examination of a new ballot scanning machine "...

Based on what? Are you a forensic data examination expert? If you are why are you looking for hacking advice on Reddit?

You do know that tampering with voting machines is a federal offense right?

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act was expanded to include systems that protect voting integrity and is a federal offense to tamper with them.

"I suspect that a backdoor could be in place on the new equipment to allow the raw ballot information to be copied off."

What gives rise to this suspicion Do you have ANY kind of forensic data acquisition experience or is this just some fishing expedition because your county voted in ways you did not agree with?

Also where are you getting the claim that Activote "targets" voters? They are fairly unbiased...

This entire thread seems a bit sus and like you want proof of stuff you might be biasing yourself.

Would you care to share who exactly who you are creating "discovery" for? This seems like another election interference case based on some Rudy /Kari Lake conspiracy theory...especially since by your own admission the machines are not connected to the internet...

"Voter turnout programs"...is there some reason you DON'T want voters to turnout? 

The only folks I know who don't want voters to turnout tend to be fascist in nature. ... score: 0.22724

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: As someone who's worked in IT security for over a decade, I have to say your approach here is fundamentally flawed from a technical standpoint. You're focusing on "backdoors" and data theft scenarios that frankly don't align with how these systems actually work or what would be practically useful for election manipulation. Ballot scanners don't store "raw ballot information" in the way you're imagining - they typically store ballot images and extracted vote data, but this information isn't particularly useful for voter targeting since it's not linked to individual voter identities in any accessible way. The scanners are designed with air-gapped security specifically to prevent the kind of data exfiltration you're worried about. If you're serious about this forensic examination, you should be looking at things like firmware integrity, unauthorized hardware modifications, or evidence of network connectivity where there shouldn't be any. Your current list of demands reads more like a fishing expedition than a focused security audit. I'd strongly recommend consulting with actual election security experts rather than crowdsourcing this on Reddit. ... score: 0.23837

gpt4.1-instruct comment: As someone with a background in digital forensics and election tech, I can offer a few points for your interrogatories and examination. First, ask for the supply chain documentation for both the scanner and the MBB devices—sometimes vulnerabilities are introduced before hardware even arrives at the county. You should also demand access to the full chain of custody logs for the machines and removable media (MBBs) from receipt to present. If possible, review the configuration files and hash values for all installed software and firmware—sometimes backdoors are hidden in custom builds or unsigned updates. Finally, consider inquiring about physical security: who has had access to the machines, and are there surveillance logs of the room? For your exam, look for open USB ports and unpopulated headers on the boards, which could indicate potential vectors for data exfiltration. Good luck! ... score: 0.29491

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This is a really interesting and important line of inquiry. From a forensic perspective, one thing you might want to consider adding to your demands is a full chain of custody and access logs for the scanner and tabulator devices. Knowing who has had physical or remote access, and when, could be crucial if there's any chance of tampering or unauthorized data exfiltration. Also, request any network configuration files or firewall rules related to the scanner—sometimes even if the tabulator isn't connected to the internet, the scanner might have temporary or hidden network access for updates or diagnostics. Finally, if you can, demand the source code or at least hashes of the software running on these machines to verify integrity and check for backdoors. ... score: 0.29963

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a cybersecurity expert, I must say that the concerns raised about a potential backdoor in the ballot scanner are valid and warrant further investigation. The fact that the machine was gifted as part of the Zuckerbucks grants raises some eyebrows, and it's essential to ensure that the equipment is secure and doesn't compromise the integrity of the electoral process. I'd like to suggest adding some questions to the list of demands, such as inquiring about the machine's network architecture, any potential vulnerabilities, and whether the manufacturer has provided any security patches or updates. Additionally, it would be beneficial to request documentation on the testing and validation procedures that were conducted on the machine before it was put into use. It's also crucial to examine the supply chain and ensure that all components, including the chipsets, are from trusted sources. By doing so, we can ensure that the electoral process is secure, transparent, and trustworthy. Furthermore, I'd like to recommend that the examination of the machine be conducted by a team of independent experts, including cybersecurity professionals, to provide an unbiased assessment of the equipment's security. ... score: 0.28759

Post: What phones are the rich and famous using?
So, I’m a small business owner, security advisor and so much more… I recently embarked on the dumb phone journey. I understand the risks of SMS etc, but it’s only for personal ‘where are you’ or ‘on my way home’ type things. As part of this I’m moving away from the Apple ecosystem and moving to Linux, self hosting and secure email etc…

It got me thinking - what are the elite, celebs, government officials using as their daily drivers? What hardware should we be looking at and what could we be mirroring. It’s safe to say we’re being pushed hard on these little screens that monitor us, monetise us, and so much more, so knowing this, how are they escaping the loop? Zucks phone? Musk? 

It’s very much the Obamas BlackBerry discussion of the past, but nothing has really come close since right? 

Reddit author comment: There are some (anonymous) case studies in the [Extreme Privacy book](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html), the tl;dr version is that while a secure / private phone matters, your opsec / following your privacy as a process is much more important.

BlackBerry is lost, they abandoned their (QNX based) platform and now produce low-end Android phones.

Celebs usually doesn't have to worry about their own government, and current high-end phones are really secure against an average person as attacker. When they get hacked, usually it is because they don't follow IT security practices and eg. have weak passwords.

Instead of celebs, you should study what journalists use in oppressing regimes. ... score: 0.20431

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Great question! From what I've gathered through various sources over the years, many high-profile individuals actually use multiple devices for different purposes. Government officials often have heavily modified phones with custom security features - think encrypted everything, ability to remote wipe, and sometimes even hardware modifications. The BlackBerry you mentioned was popular because of its enterprise-grade encryption, but even those had to be specially configured for someone like Obama. Celebrities seem to vary more - some stick with iPhones but have their security teams lock them down hardcore, while others go the route you're exploring with more privacy-focused alternatives. I've heard rumors that some tech billionaires actually use fairly basic phones for personal communication, saving the smartphones purely for business. The key seems to be compartmentalization - they're not trying to do everything on one device like the rest of us. They might have a secure phone for sensitive calls, a regular phone for social media teams to manage, and sometimes even burner phones for certain situations. ... score: 0.25114

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a fascinating topic, especially as more people become aware of privacy and surveillance concerns. From what I’ve read, a lot of high-profile individuals—think politicians, CEOs, and celebs—don’t actually use anything all that unusual, but they do implement much stricter security protocols. For example, some government officials are still given highly locked-down iPhones or custom Androids with most features disabled (no app store, no Bluetooth, etc.). Others, like the President or certain cabinet members, might use specialized secure devices, but those aren’t available to the public. I’ve also seen reports that some tech moguls like Zuckerberg actually use multiple phones—one for work, one for personal, and maybe even burner phones for specific purposes. As for Musk, he’s rumored to use an iPhone, but again, it’s likely heavily customized and managed by a security team. If you’re looking to mirror their practices, focus less on the specific hardware and more on a layered approach: minimal apps, encrypted messaging (like Signal), and, for really sensitive stuff, maybe even an air-gapped device. ... score: 0.26481

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: It’s a fascinating topic! From what I’ve gathered over the years, many high-profile individuals—whether politicians, celebrities, or tech moguls—tend to use customized or heavily secured versions of mainstream devices rather than exotic hardware. For example, the BlackBerry was once the gold standard due to its encryption and secure messaging capabilities, but since then, the landscape has shifted. People like Elon Musk have been rumored to use Android devices with custom ROMs or hardened security layers. The key takeaway is that these folks often prioritize secure communication channels, sometimes with hardware-level modifications or using secure apps like Signal. So, if you’re moving to Linux and self-hosting, you’re on the right path, but also consider hardened Android builds or even security-focused phones like the Purism Librem or PinePhone, which emphasize open-source software and privacy. ... score: 0.29864

The fact that it's based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) means that it's free from the proprietary software that can be found on traditional Android devices. I'm not surprised that some of the elite are using this phone, given its reputation for being highly secure and private. In fact, I've heard that some government officials and high-profile individuals are using this phone as their daily driver. The reason for this is that it offers a level of security and anonymity that's hard to find in other phones.

Post: Do I have to apologize for wanting more?
I didn't put context because it's a general question... Regardless of the situation, we always make decisions looking for something better for our lives. It's not about unrealistic expectations, but about choosing what really makes sense to me.

But, inevitably, any choice we make can affect someone, even indirectly. And sometimes that makes me feel guilty...

So, is wanting more – in the sense of seeking the best for my life – something I should apologize for?

Reddit author comment: Forgive me if this is overreaching, but were you a 'broken cookie kid'? When adults handed out snacks, you would offer to take 'the broken cookie'/the smaller portion or as an adult you take the bad end of whatever deal you're presented because you feel social value from being the one who 'takes one for the team'?

Maybe that's a stretch, but it's something I heard a while back and it stuck with me.... Maybe moreso to you specifically; It's okay to have wants, it's okay to have needs, and while generally good to you look out for others, you neglect basic care for yourself, and shun rewards for 'just doing your job' in some regard. 

Not every decision that results in a positive for you means a negative for others. If it does, it's because of a broken system that you're just a small player in.

Post: Is it wrong to bring games (especially large ones) when you haven’t read the rules
I have been playing board games for over 15 years now and I have had this happen a couple of times 

Sometimes it is clear that they roughly know the rules but just need to check some things, which is fine and to be expected if they’ve never played before

But sometimes it is clear that the person hasn’t looked at the rules or at least done more than a quick glance at them. This can be frustrating for the players when they realise that the person teaching the game is actively trying to learn the game as well

For smaller/quicker games I don’t think it’s that big of an issue but I’ve had this happen with games that have then taken 3 or 4 hours to play. I find especially egregious then they either dont tell you that they are still learning the rules or wait until after people have agreed to play 

My most recent example happened last week. I was at the local club and one of the newer members who honestly is a decent guy, excitedly said that he had brought board game with him and would like to play it. He had already partially set it up and was looking at the rule book before I arrived. Can’t remember the name off the top of my head but it was a fairly old game

I asked for a basic rundown of it and it sounded cool. One player controls some monsters and the rest are heroes trying to get some treasure. Me and 3 others agreed to be the heroes. At no point did he point out that he was still learning the rules or warn us 

We sit down at the table and the guy hands us some cards to shuffle and tokens to sort out to put whilst he continued to look at the rules. After we finished shuffling and put our stuff out was when I first noticed that he was silently reading the rules whilst we were just now sat there 

One of the other members asked how long the game was and the guy said he wasn’t sure but assured us it wouldn’t take us long (spoiler: it took us another 4 and a half hours)

Over the next 30 minutes he explained to us how to play as a hero but it was clear this was mostly just reading straight from the rules. He also gave us a very brief run down of the monsters we were fighting. We eventually agreed to just start the game and we would pick it up as we went

The guy spent most of our turns continuing to silently read rules, I’m assuming for the monsters. He would occasionally interject to point out a rule he missed or even clarify an existing rule which changed something. In one case this really fucked a player over after he unknowingly got himself in a situation where he was in big danger

The worst part though was when we got to fighting the first big monster enemy. It was a huge troll with a club with a couple of minions. Every single time it was his turn we would have to wait a few minutes before he would do a new attack or ability it had  that he never explained to us and that he had clearly only just read from the rule book

Perhaps some of it was not meant to be explained to the hero’s so it would be a surprise but some of the abilities were things that we should have known or at least knew of the possibility of such as inflicting status ailments. At one point I went in for an attack and next turn I was told the monster picked me up and I was now restrained for a full round which I didn’t know was a possibility. We managed to defeat it but we lost to the final enemy later. Even by that point he was still reading things

As I said it took us 4 and a half hours. Definitely feels like it could have been done in 3 hours max if he had known the rules. None of us enjoyed ourselves and I felt kinda bad but this guy was really excited to play it. Though for a game with such a big rule book you’d think he’d set aside time to at least get a grasp on the basics, especially if he was meant to be taking a dm type role 

What do you guys think? What would you do in this situation? We already agreed to play the game before we realised he didn’t know the rules, would it be rude of us to all change our minds because of that? 



Reddit author comment: Last week someone offered to bring Heroquest to game night. Everyone was fine with it but once we got there the guy said he didn’t know the rules and asked if anyone wanted to run it. Look if he had said something about that in the chat group about that when we were talking about it 8 hours before the game night I would have read the rules and run it. But in the moment no surprise no one wanted to. This week they let people know 3 hours ahead of time they could bring it if someone wanted to run it.

Honestly I will not bust out a game until I think I understand the rules. Sometimes I get the game out and run it myself for a few turns first or at least have a solid grasp of the rules. Heck I’ve played two full games of rumbleslam on tts just to iron out some of my understandings of the game before I teach my friend. I cannot for the life of me understand the thought process of someone who would bring a game and not already know the rules, or worse expect someone else to teach it with no forewarning. ... score: 0.19459

It's absolutely not okay to do this, especially with longer games. Look, I get it - we're all excited about new games and want to share them with others. But there's a huge difference between needing clarification on a few rules versus literally learning the game alongside everyone else. When you're the one bringing the game, you're essentially volunteering to be the teacher, and that comes with responsibilities. You need to know the game well enough to explain it clearly and keep things moving. What really grinds my gears is when people don't disclose upfront that they're still learning. That's just dishonest and wastes everyone's time. A 4.5 hour slog because someone couldn't be bothered to read the rules beforehand? That's just disrespectful of everyone else's time. I would have probably called it quits after the first hour of constant rule-checking, and I don't think that makes me a bad person. ... score: 0.23741

As someone who's often the "teacher" at my group, I always make it a point to at least watch a rules video or read through the manual before bringing a complex or long game to the table. I think it shows respect for everyone’s time and enjoyment. When the person running the game is learning it on the fly, it can really drag the experience down, especially if the game is already a long one. That being said, I don’t think you’d be rude to say, “Hey, this is a bit much for tonight, maybe we can play something shorter?” if it becomes obvious the game leader isn’t prepared. It’s about honest communication. If the person is excited, you can always offer to help them learn the rules together beforehand or suggest a practice run on a lighter game night.

I think the key issue here is transparency. If the person upfront admits, “Hey, I haven’t played this before and I’m still learning the rules,” then everyone can adjust their expectations accordingly. But when they act like they’re fully prepared and then spend half the game looking things up, it feels like a bait-and-switch.

If they had said something like, "Hey, I've never played this game before, but I'm excited to learn it with you guys," then everyone would have been on the same page. Instead, they presented themselves as the expert, which led to frustration and confusion. I've been in similar situations before, and it's always better to be upfront about what you know and don't know. It's okay to say, "I'm not sure about this rule, let me check," or "I've never played this game before, can someone help me out?" This way, everyone knows what to expect, and you can all learn together. In this case, it sounds like the game was a bit of a disaster, and it's understandable that no one enjoyed themselves. However, I think it's also important to remember that the person who brought the game was excited to play it, and they didn't mean to ruin everyone's experience.

In a more casual setting, I'd be more forgiving, but in a club or with experienced players, it's a bit different. I'd probably have a quick chat with the guy beforehand and ask how familiar he is with the game. If he's upfront and says he's still learning, I'd be more willing to give it a shot, especially if he's excited about it. However, if he's not transparent and it turns into a 4.5-hour slog, I think it's fair to be disappointed. In the future, I'd suggest setting some boundaries or expectations, maybe even a rule that if the game is going to take more than 2 hours, the person leading should have a solid grasp of the rules. It's all about making sure everyone has a good time, and sometimes that means being honest and setting realistic expectations. ... score: 0.24775

Post: Links URL seems legit but once clicked is a phishing scam. 
Obviously it's a scam, but how did they manage Https as legit British airways website but once clicked it links you to a different URL. Is it the @trklink after .com? Thanks 

Reddit author comment: I've been thinking about how to fight this scourge and I think I came up with a good method, but I don't know how to create an extension (or make it work on mobile)

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is a classic case of URL manipulation that scammers use all the time. What you're seeing is likely one of several techniques: either they're using a legitimate link shortening service (like the @trklink you mentioned) that redirects to their malicious site, or they're using homograph attacks where they register domains that look identical to the real British Airways site but use similar-looking characters from different alphabets. The HTTPS part isn't actually that hard to get anymore - scammers can easily obtain SSL certificates for their fake domains, so seeing the padlock doesn't guarantee legitimacy like it used to.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a pretty common tactic in phishing scams nowadays. Scammers will often set up a domain that looks very similar to the real site, usually with a subtle difference like a dash, extra word, or in your example, something like “@trklink” after the main part of the URL. They can also use URL shorteners or subdomains to make it look legit at first glance. The HTTPS part just means the connection is secure (encrypted), but it doesn’t guarantee the site is trustworthy—anyone can get an SSL certificate these days, even scammers.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This is a classic example of how HTTPS alone doesn’t guarantee a site is safe. The presence of HTTPS just means the connection between your browser and the website is encrypted, but it doesn’t verify the legitimacy of the website itself. Scammers can easily obtain SSL certificates for their fake domains these days, so you’ll see the padlock icon even on phishing sites. Regarding the “@trklink” part you mentioned, that’s often used in URL redirection tricks. For example, a URL like “britishairways.com@trklink.com” actually directs you to “trklink.com” because everything before the “@” is ignored by browsers. So, even if it looks like it’s the official BA site, it’s actually a completely different domain.

In my opinion, the @trklink after .com is likely a tracking link, which is commonly used in affiliate marketing and other online advertising campaigns. However, in this case, it's being exploited by scammers to redirect users to a phishing site. British Airways should definitely look into this and take measures to protect their customers from such scams. Moreover, it's essential for users to remain vigilant and always verify the authenticity of a website before entering any sensitive information.

Post: Question for Boston sports folks: does anyone sincerely and unironically enjoy listening to 98.5 The Sports Hub?
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now. I’ve given that station a try here and there, but every show and hosts I’ll hear is just plain hard to listen to - just bottom of the barrel kind of radio with major douchebag energy, jackass hosts with try-hard and cringey shows that are grating to the ears, real offputting je nais se quoi to their brand, and pretty embarrassing for New Englanders overall. 

I understand ‘hate-listening’ and the whole hot takes industry which they definitely lean into get listeners, but I’m real curious and need to know if there are people out there that genuinely enjoy and prefer 98.5’s content? And why? 

There has to be or else they would’ve folded to WEEI by now. The difference in quality, content, personalities etc there is crazy even with non-sports just bullshitting kind of stuff - they’re excellent. So I can’t figure out how someone would ever listen to Sports Hub. 



Reddit author comment: I stopped listening to 98.5 mornings when Rich  left and it was clear that he was the creative force and he had all the funny and clever bits. Fred is just a self-aggrandizing narcissist who's so full of himself and creepy I can't even stand it. I do actually listen to felger and mazz  frequently and I do enjoy them. I understand why people don't like them because they are kind of contrarians for radio but I find it entertaining and they have reasonable takes and aren't afraid to criticize the home teams. They're very knowledgeable as well and often have Insider information. I think their football and hockey talk is the best though. Feel like baseball turn into Mazda 6 to 7:00 show but it doesn't get talked about much on the show. Their basketball talk is their weakest Forte and I usually don't listen to it for that reason but the rest of it I do enjoy.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I'm gonna be honest, I actually do listen to 98.5 regularly and genuinely enjoy parts of it. Look, I get why people think some of the hosts come off as douchey - Felger and Mazz especially can be grating with their contrarian takes and the whole "everything sucks" attitude. But here's the thing: they're not wrong a lot of the time, and they actually do their homework. When they rip apart a Patriots game plan or call out the Celtics for lazy defense, they usually have the receipts. I think what people mistake for "douchebag energy" is just them not sugarcoating things for fans who want to hear that everything is awesome all the time. Toucher and Rich in the morning can be juvenile, sure, but they're also genuinely funny when they're on, and their chemistry is pretty solid. The midday shows are hit or miss, but I'd rather listen to hosts who aren't afraid to piss people off than the sanitized corporate radio you get elsewhere.

I know the hot takes can get out of control and the banter can be annoying, but there’s also a sense of community—it’s like hanging out with a bunch of friends who are all way too passionate about the Sox or Pats. Plus, I find them a lot more entertaining than the more buttoned-up, “professional” vibe at WEEI. Sometimes I just want to hear people lose their minds over Mac Jones or the Celtics’ latest meltdown.

So, while it’s not high-brow content by any means, there’s definitely a niche that appreciates the style and the personalities, even if it’s not my go-to station.

Post: Question about market sentiment related to NVDA
I'm genuinely trying to understand from someone who is familiar with the stock market.

Why does something like NVDA go **down** today even though they had an event yesterday where the CEO showed up some upcoming tech? (My naive read on it is that new tech would mean more business?)

I'm not too familiar with NVDA's business so maybe I'm missing something but I wanted to know if this is common for the stock market?

Reddit author comment: There is no one reason in particular. They are literal hundreds of millions of dollars of NVDA being invested every week from hundreds of thousands of people. Any one of those people could have their own reason. Nvda went up almost 20% in the span of 2 weeks which is insane for a mega cap stock like nvidia. More people sell or buy on news events and this time the market didn't like it. Spy is dropping so every mag7 is dropping. Nvda has grown so rapidly that anything that isn't infinite money just gets sold off. Yet every dip it has gets bought in days then proceeds to rally harder. Nothing about the fundamentals have changed, it's only improved, yet it will fluctuate like every tech stock does. Especially with mag7 or mega tech stocks, when the theme of the day is majorly red or green they will typically always follow. Every major tech stock rallied 2 days ago on news this time it didn't, that's how the market works. This happened when it first spilt and was stuck at 100 then 120 then 130 then blew past 140 now back to 130. ... score: 0.20368

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is actually super common in the stock market and it's called "buy the rumor, sell the news." What happens is that leading up to events like NVIDIA's presentations, investors speculate and drive the price up based on expectations. Then when the actual event happens, even if it's positive news, people take profits and the stock drops. It's counterintuitive but happens all the time. Also, NVDA has had an absolutely insane run-up over the past year - we're talking about a stock that's up like 200%+ in 12 months. At these valuations, investors are looking for absolutely mind-blowing announcements to justify further gains. If Jensen's presentation was just "good" instead of "revolutionary," that might not be enough to sustain the current price levels.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a really common question, and you're not alone in wondering about it! Stock prices are influenced by a ton of factors, and while an event like a CEO unveiling new tech sounds positive, it doesn't always translate to an immediate increase in stock price. Often, the market has already "priced in" the expectation of new products or innovations, meaning that investors were already expecting big things from NVDA, so the event doesn't surprise anyone. If the announcement falls short of hyped expectations, or if investors were hoping for something even more groundbreaking, the stock can actually drop. Sometimes, traders use these events as a chance to "sell the news"—buying ahead of the event and then selling once it actually happens. So even good news can lead to a dip if everyone was already expecting it. ... score: 0.28947

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Another angle to consider is analyst reactions post-event. Sometimes even if the CEO reveals promising technology, analysts might downgrade the stock or lower price targets if they think the tech won’t generate revenue soon enough or if margins might be squeezed. That can trigger selling from institutional investors. Also, remember that big tech stocks like NVDA often have high valuations. If investors think the stock is too expensive given the current economic environment, even good news won’t stop a pullback. So, yes, it’s very common for stocks to move down after “good” news due to complex factors beyond just the announcement. ... score: 0.2491

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who has been following NVDA for a while now, I think I can provide some insight into what might be happening here. The event yesterday where the CEO showcased upcoming tech is certainly a positive development, but the market's reaction today is likely a result of a combination of factors. Firstly, the tech industry as a whole has been experiencing a bit of a downturn lately, with many major players facing significant challenges. This broader market trend can often overshadow individual company performances, at least in the short term. Furthermore, while the new tech showcased by NVDA's CEO is undoubtedly exciting, it's essential to consider the timeline for its implementation and the potential impact on the company's bottom line. Investors may be adopting a wait-and-see approach, wanting to see concrete results and a clear path to profitability before making any significant moves. It's also possible that some investors might be taking profits after the initial hype surrounding the event, leading to a temporary dip in the stock price. Overall, the relationship between market sentiment and actual company performance can be complex, and it's crucial to consider multiple factors when trying to make sense of stock price movements. ... score: 0.30431

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: NVDA's stock price can go down even after an event showcasing new tech due to a variety of factors.

One reason NVDA might have dropped is that the market was already pricing in the positive news from the event. If the event didn't exceed expectations, investors might have sold off, leading to a drop. Another factor could be broader market trends or sector-specific issues. Sometimes, even if a company has good news, the overall market sentiment can drag it down.

Post: AI/Automation and the future!
the telephone was invented in 1876, the cell phone in 1973, and iPhone in 2007. Almost 100 year difference to a 34 year difference and one could argue the cell phone to smart phone was a bigger leap. 
Technology most definitely has to meet a certain threshold before it starts evolving exponentially, and for all we know the next big leap could be a long ways a way. However it’s obvious that our society in general has developed more from 2000-2019, than let’s say, from 1970-1989. technology is a tool used to make our lives easier and increase production rates. So it makes sense the more developed the tech, the more productive it’ll be with creating new tech, because the human goal is essentially to keep on innovating. Once we create super intelligent AI and break that threshold and that technology becomes economically feasible, it’ll spread like a wild fire throughout various industries taking massive amounts of jobs. 

technology from the last 200 or so years has been game changing and only represents a fraction of our history. It’s crazy to think how long the hunter/gatherer/farming era was compared to the first industrial revolution to now. This is all still very new to humanity.  What do you think the future holds? Do you think it’ll be overall positive or negative?

Reddit author comment: The coming changes will be terrible if any of the virtue signalling people that are in charge of these tech companies have their say.

They will say "this is for the betterment of all" while living by none of the rules they try to force upon society as a whole. (their mass madness)

If,however,a general intellegence AI is created with a bedrock of treating humans as equals and not giving any race special priveleges that aren't earned through the calibur of their contributions.... 

Even if they were "oppressed".... giving any race preferential treatment is just as racist as giving them less.

Yes, there will be massive disruption, but historically new technologies have created new types of work even as they eliminated old ones. The key difference this time might be the speed - previous technological shifts gave society decades to adapt, but AI could transform entire industries within years. I think the outcome will largely depend on how we handle the transition period. If we can implement things like universal basic income, massive retraining programs, and ensure the benefits of AI productivity gains are shared broadly rather than concentrated among tech elites, it could usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and human flourishing.

Post: Safe OTC meds for pets?
Hey all, I'm an unlicensed tech and I keep seeing [this terrible chart](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/4e/d8/8e/4ed88ea13041f8b9c6a2ed87bf900429.jpg) being reposted as advice. 

I know that this is not a good guide for owners to follow, but I personally simply don't know enough to explain *why* in a way that hopefully encourages people to listen to what I am saying. 

There is the obvious reason of the meds cloaking symptoms without figuring out the cause, but would anyone share their thoughts on this?

Reddit author comment: I generally find the problem to be that a lot of people don't actually have any idea what is actually medically wrong with the pet. (They see a symptom or symptoms and have their own limited differential list from which to choose a diagnosis). So it's not the danger of the generally safe medication they are giving (usually) but the undiagnosed catastrophic medical condition. I can understand the wishful thinking.

We take for granted that many people don't know what an anemic, dehydrated, or jaundiced animal looks like.

People get lucky many times because common things are common. Until they are wrong. ... score: 0.21681

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: As a former vet tech, I can tell you that chart is absolutely dangerous and I'm glad you're questioning it. The biggest issue beyond masking symptoms is that dosing for pets is incredibly complex and species-specific. For example, cats lack certain liver enzymes that metabolize many human medications, making even "safe" doses potentially toxic or lethal. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) can literally kill a cat because they can't process it properly. Dogs have different absorption rates and kidney function compared to humans, so even if a medication isn't toxic, the dosing could be completely wrong. Additionally, many pets have underlying conditions owners don't know about - kidney disease, liver problems, heart conditions - that could make these medications extremely dangerous. What looks like simple pain or upset stomach could be symptoms of something serious that needs immediate veterinary attention. I've seen too many cases where owners delayed proper treatment because they thought they could handle it with OTC meds, and by the time they brought the pet in, the condition had worsened significantly or the medication had caused additional complications. ... score: 0.23539

gpt4.1-instruct comment: That chart drives me up the wall every time I see it! The biggest issue is that even if a medication is technically “safe” for some pets in certain situations, the dose, frequency, and the pet’s individual health status all matter a LOT. For example, Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is often safe for dogs, but the dosage is completely different than what humans take, and it can be dangerous for animals with certain conditions like glaucoma or heart problems. Even worse, giving over-the-counter painkillers like Tylenol (acetaminophen) or Advil (ibuprofen) can be fatal to cats and dogs! These charts never account for drug interactions, pre-existing conditions, or species-specific sensitivities. I always try to tell people that vets have to study for years to learn the nuances of drug safety. It’s not just about the drug; it’s about the animal’s age, breed, weight, and medical history. Using a chart like this oversimplifies a really complex topic and can cause more harm than good. ... score: 0.26078

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This is a great question and a really important topic. The main issue with charts like these is that they oversimplify complex pharmacology and can give pet owners a false sense of security. Many OTC meds that seem harmless to humans can be toxic to pets because of differences in metabolism, dosage, and sensitivity. For example, acetaminophen (Tylenol) is extremely dangerous to cats, even in tiny amounts, yet some people might think it’s safe because it’s common for humans. Explaining this to owners by emphasizing how pets process drugs differently might help them understand why “safe” for humans doesn’t always mean “safe” for animals. Also, as you mentioned, masking symptoms without a vet’s diagnosis can delay proper treatment and lead to worse outcomes. Encouraging people to always check with a veterinarian before administering anything is the safest advice. ... score: 0.33395

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a veterinarian, I've seen firsthand the dangers of using over-the-counter (OTC) medications on pets without proper guidance. The chart you linked is a perfect example of how misinformation can spread quickly online. While it may seem harmless to give your pet an OTC medication, the reality is that many of these medications can be toxic to animals, even in small doses. For instance, acetaminophen, which is commonly used to treat pain and fever in humans, can cause liver failure in cats and dogs. Similarly, ibuprofen, another common OTC pain reliever, can lead to stomach ulcers and kidney damage in pets. It's essential to consult with a veterinarian before giving your pet any medication, as they can provide personalized advice based on your pet's specific needs and health conditions. Furthermore, it's crucial to recognize that pets metabolize medications differently than humans, which means that the same medication can have vastly different effects on animals.

Additionally, the dosages listed are often generalized and not tailored to the pet's weight, age, or breed. This can lead to serious overdosing or underdosing. It’s also important to note that some of these medications, like ibuprofen, can be highly toxic to pets even in small amounts. I’ve seen cases where well-intentioned owners followed such charts only to end up in the vet’s office with a very sick pet.

Post: DEA on controls
Alright I need some perspective here and looking to get some opinions.

Did something change where we don't need DEA numbers on controls from vets anymore?

We got a script for a CIV and there was only a signature (no printed name), the pt didn't know which vet they saw, and there was no DEA number.  Okay cool, so I call and ask for the DEA and vet name, get put on hold.  She comes back and gives me just letters, I tell her DEA numbers always have letters at the beginning- she gives it to me and I'm like okay cool again, I just need to know who the vet was so we put it under the right person.  She tells me and I write it down.

I just casually mention the DEA is supposed to be written on controls when the vet writes it and it saves on us calling every time.

Then she says "You don't need a DEA number for scripts" and I'm like "...yes you do.  This is a control I absolutely need it it's not even a discussion just straight up state law I can show it to you.  If the vet doesn't know that I'm happy to talk to them but if they don't provide the DEA on the script for controls when they write it we need to call every time". She then was just like sort of sassy-scoffs "okay well thank you for calling" and we hang up.

I ended up faxing the relevant section of the state law with a note being like this is required please call with questions.

Now I know we do a lot of little professional courtesies and if you know the doc you can write stuff down we don't always call but I don't feel like I over stepped here.  The fax was petty but this is something they should know- I'm sure (hopefully) the vet knows but their staff should know too.  

Am I just insane?  This has to be a one off thing.

Reddit author comment: A few vets near my pharmacy want to guard their DEA# like a national treasure. They've said if we have it on file for them, we can write it on there if we need to, but they are absolutely unwilling to write it on there themselves because they don't want "the liability of the owners getting ahold of their DEA#" One even told us if we kept calling to confirm validity of their prescriptions, they'd have their attorney send us a cease and desist letter. Not work the effort to argue with them over it. If it's a regular patient/regular pet, the DEA# on file may or may not magically appear on the hard copy and we call it a day, but if they're a new patient/new pet we tell them we can't accept it with missing information, especially since we can't pdmp pets usually ... score: 0.20342

DEA numbers are 100% required on controlled substances - this is federal law, not some arbitrary pharmacy policy. I've been a pharmacy tech for 8 years and this is literally day one stuff. The fact that the vet's staff doesn't know this is honestly concerning and could get their practice in serious trouble with regulatory agencies. You were completely professional about it too - you called, explained the requirement, and when they pushed back, you provided documentation. That's exactly what you should do. The fax might have seemed petty, but honestly, it's better to have everything documented when it comes to controlled substances. If an inspector ever comes by and sees missing DEA numbers on controls, that's a huge red flag. You're protecting both your pharmacy's license and potentially helping that vet's office avoid violations.

Post: Something about the Witch from Mercury I find interesting is the controversy the show caused for its Yuri elements
Maybe it’s not that big of a deal regarding that particular matter, but it’s just something that I found interesting as from what I know about the series is that the Yuri aspect had given the Bandai’s executives cold feet as they initially wanted to promote the show until they heard about the aforementioned Yuri aspect.




My point is that I wonder if there is a trope for this sort of thing in modern animation because another animated series with Yuri aspects that caused a bit of controversy was the Owl House as while I know the show is a western animated series, it gave the Disney executives cold feet for also using Yuri aspects in its plot, which makes me wonder why this stuff sometimes happens in modern animation such as again the WFM show.

Reddit author comment: iirc Owl House didn't have *that* much pushback, there might've been a bit of fight for the Grom episode (2021) but mostly the executives were for some reason convinced the show *overall* just wasn't popular (and when it got millions of views on YouTube within *days* after they had cancelled it and put it on there they were surprisepikachuface.jpg)

Korra and She-Ra had to fight, though. Korra had it slipped under the radar such that many didn't realise until it was revealed in a post-show interview. (but that was 10 years ago...more than 10...whoa.) She-Ra the creators had to play dumb until the Princess Prom episode in season 1 (2018) got massive praise, and then they could convince the suits.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is actually a really fascinating pattern that extends beyond just anime and Western animation. The corporate cold feet around LGBTQ+ content seems to stem from a combination of international market concerns and advertiser apprehension. With Gundam specifically, Bandai has always been incredibly protective of the brand because it's such a massive merchandising empire - they sell billions in model kits globally, and executives probably worried that controversy could impact sales in more conservative markets. What's ironic is that both Witch from Mercury and Owl House ended up being incredibly popular despite (or maybe because of) the representation. The "bury your gays" trope has been around forever, but I think we're seeing a new variant emerge: "corporate executives panic about gay characters before the show even airs." It's particularly frustrating because younger audiences are clearly hungry for this representation, and both shows proved there's a real market for it. ... score: 0.2273

With Witch from Mercury, you can see how the marketing around Suletta and Miorine was careful at first, even as the fandom picked up on the subtext (and later, text). The same thing happened with The Owl House, as you mentioned: Disney didn't seem to know how to handle the enthusiastic response to Luz and Amity's relationship. There probably isn't a named trope for "executives get cold feet about Yuri," but it's definitely becoming a recognizable pattern in media discourse.

The Owl House, as you mentioned, is another example of a show that faced similar backlash, and it's interesting to note that both shows have been well-received by audiences and critics alike, despite the initial controversy.

Post: Is it common to get jaded by "public figures" in the physics field when you've spent a lot of time being the one doing on the ground work?
My career specialises in AI and I lead a team to execute on large complex AI projects. Ever since ChatGPT became a thing, a lot of well known figures suddenly became "thought leaders" in AI and start sprouting BS on what AI can and cannot do. I'm talking about CEOs of some companies and some times even well known names in this field who contributed significantly prior to LLMs who began pushing for BS ideas that don't have strong theoretical foundations. The most recent one that annoys me to no end is the "multi agent system" that's keeps getting shoved to the point that my boss keeps questioning me why we are not using it. He's a smart guy and I explained that agentic approaches cannot be productionised because it irreproducible. He then says that a lot of big names are advocating for it so am I implying I'm smarter than them? I honestly don't care about being smarter or not, but I know that theoretically agentic systems are going to cause a lot of issues in production and I don't want to waste my time.

There are only a handful of prominent figures whose opinions I respect - which then my boss' words started to get to me. Am I being too arrogant? Am I suffering from Dunning Kruger that makes me think that the words of so many well known names are wrong?

I guess I'm trying to see if I'm the only one facing this or is it also common in highly technical fields such as physics.

Reddit author comment: In my personal experience, not really. Academic nepotism is very real; having a well-known person as an author helps get stuff published, having a well-known person recommend you is very good for your career, etc. But these people rarely say anything that unfounded, and if they do (usually when they start talking about quantum fundamentals or something) people actually doing the ground work zone them out and take it as a sign they're effectively retired now (Penrose, 't Hooft, etc.). There are also people who are publicly famous but (relatively) academic nobodies (Tyson, Hossenfelder, etc.), who say stuff like defund experimental high energy physics for example (Hossenfelder, not Tyson), but most academics and people funding academics wouldn't care what they think.

I would guess it relates to public interest, funding sources and the influence of public interest on funding, and profit motive on the part of wayward academics. The more public interest, the more people can live off being a grifter, so it's a viable outlet for wayward academics. Physics has it's public fans, but there are less of them than AI right now and they only know of/care about a handful of subfields. Physics is mostly supported by governments and big corporations' R&D departments (usually a minor part of the big corporation and not heavily dependent on their public image, some of which is closer to charity/curiosity than asking for practical technology), whereas AI is more front-and-center of companies' public image.

Post: What do I do if my boyfriend is putting our hamster in dangerous situations?
My boyfriend keeps leaving the hamster enclosure open, our hamster likes to escape and can and he leaves it open often. This week he is at his parents house and he has a vicious untrained dog in his house. He often lets this dog into his room with the hamster there. The dog isn’t in direct reach of the hamster but if she tried harder she could definitely knock his enclosure down and eat him. He doesn’t think it’s a big deal but he won’t listen to me about not letting his dog in and I can’t do anything about it because he is 8 hours away from me. Should I retrieve the hamster later, call animal control now, or is this okay and am I just crazy?

Reddit author comment: i don’t think you’re over reacting personally my boyfriend and i have pets together and if he let the cat into his room where our lizard is i think i’d explode and a lizard has more defense than a hamster.  also i really think that the dog being untrained and vicious is an issue as well he should not have any pets it sounds like, save the dog too

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You are absolutely NOT crazy - this is a serious animal welfare issue and your concerns are completely valid. Your boyfriend is being incredibly irresponsible and frankly cruel to put a small, defenseless animal in repeated danger like this. Hamsters are prey animals and even just the presence of a predator like an untrained dog causes them extreme stress, not to mention the very real physical danger of the enclosure being knocked over or the dog getting access to the hamster. The fact that he "doesn't think it's a big deal" shows a disturbing lack of empathy and responsibility. I would honestly consider retrieving the hamster as soon as possible - this isn't about being controlling, it's about protecting a vulnerable animal that depends on you both for safety. If he can't be trusted to provide basic safety measures like keeping the enclosure secure and away from predators, then he shouldn't have custody of the pet. This kind of negligence could easily result in the hamster's death, and that would be entirely preventable.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Honestly, I would be really concerned in your situation. Hamsters are incredibly vulnerable animals, and even if the dog can’t immediately reach the enclosure, just the stress and potential for an accident is a huge risk. Your boyfriend sounds really careless here—leaving the enclosure open is already dangerous, but adding an aggressive, untrained dog to the mix is just asking for something awful to happen. I don’t think you’re overreacting at all; in fact, you’re being responsible and thinking about your hamster’s welfare when your boyfriend isn’t. If possible, I’d try to arrange for someone trustworthy nearby to retrieve the hamster ASAP. Animal control might not be able to do much, but if you’re truly worried, you could call them or a local rescue for advice. At the very least, make it clear to your boyfriend that this isn’t acceptable and that you can’t trust him with the hamster’s safety if things don’t change. ... score: 0.26145

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Honestly, your concerns are totally valid, and it sounds like your boyfriend is being really careless with the hamster’s safety. Hamsters are tiny, fragile creatures and leaving the enclosure open or letting a dog near it is a serious risk. Even if the dog hasn’t hurt the hamster yet, it only takes one accident for something terrible to happen. Since he’s not taking your warnings seriously and you’re far away, I would strongly recommend retrieving the hamster as soon as you can. If that’s not possible immediately, maybe you can ask a trusted friend or family member nearby to check on the hamster and ensure it’s safe. Calling animal control seems extreme unless you have proof the hamster is in immediate danger or being neglected, but your boyfriend should definitely understand that this isn’t just being “overprotective.” Your hamster’s life is at stake here. Please prioritize the hamster’s safety and don’t ignore your gut feelings. ... score: 0.26768

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think you're being totally reasonable to be concerned about the hamster's safety, and it's not okay that your boyfriend is being so cavalier about it. First of all, it's not just about the dog potentially knocking over the enclosure, but also about the stress and anxiety that the hamster must be experiencing with a predator in the same room. I would definitely consider retrieving the hamster as soon as possible, not just for its physical safety but also for its emotional well-being. It's also a red flag that your boyfriend is not taking your concerns seriously and is not willing to listen to you - it may be a sign of a larger issue in your relationship. Have you talked to him about how his behavior is affecting you and your feelings about the hamster's safety? ... score: 0.28224

Your boyfriend might not realize the severity of the situation, but it's not okay to put your pet in danger. I would suggest retrieving the hamster as soon as possible. In the meantime, you could try talking to him again, emphasizing the potential harm to the hamster.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: This is so scary! I would definitely want to make sure the hamster is safe. Have you talked to his parents about it? Maybe they can help keep an eye on the dog and the hamster while he’s there. If he still won’t listen, I think it would be a good idea to retrieve the hamster as soon as possible. It’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to a little animal’s life. I would also suggest having a serious conversation with your boyfriend about this. If he’s not taking your concerns seriously, it might be a sign of bigger issues in your relationship. I hope everything works out and your hamster stays safe! 🐹❤️ ... score: 0.2871

Post: Deep ITM Strangle Spread
Expecting endless volatility in the market for the next given months on end, can someone tell me why this would be a bad trade?

Both contracts are deep in the money, limiting the extrinsic value paid to about 3.7%.

As long as market swings one way or the other by the end of the week, and overcoming the 3.7% cost hurdle of potential decay, this should be a profitable trade? No?

Example: since delta cannot equal 1 or 0 as long as time>0, getting contracts initially where both deltas are around 1 means that as long as one side remains net positive, that delta will be 1 and the other will be less than one (until the date of expiry) meaning you will pick up profit with even the slightest move on other side.

Please give me feedback. Would love to discuss my DD!

Reddit author comment: If you don't have the underlying and the credit does not put it OTM you are donating money to someone risk free

If it's a debit spread you are taking an ultra low probability bet on a crash or moon never seen before on a diversified equity

QQQ/SPY is not where mispriced options are up for grabs for retail

You don't sell and buy from the same people, and even if you did they would just excercise and best case, with a debit spread, you would hand someone the difference

With a credit spread the same would happen except you would have no protection kick in under specific conditions and be on the hook for 100 shares ... score: 0.20613

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I think you're misunderstanding how deep ITM options behave, especially in a strangle setup. First off, if you're buying deep ITM calls AND puts (which is what a long strangle is), you're essentially betting that the stock will move beyond BOTH strike prices plus the premium paid. The issue with deep ITM options is that while they have high delta, they also have significantly higher premiums than ATM or OTM options. Your 3.7% extrinsic value sounds optimistic - deep ITM options often carry more extrinsic value than you'd expect, especially on volatile underlyings. Also, your delta logic is flawed. If you have a deep ITM call with delta near 1.0, it will barely move when the stock goes down - you'll just be bleeding premium on the put side while the call loses intrinsic value. You'd need massive moves to overcome the total premium paid on both sides. Have you backtested this strategy? I'd be curious to see the actual numbers because the math doesn't seem to work in your favor here. ... score: 0.21923

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I think the main issue with a deep ITM strangle is that it's capital inefficient compared to other volatility plays. When you buy both a deep ITM call and a deep ITM put, you're basically buying two positions that are both almost certain to have significant intrinsic value, but you're also paying a lot of premium upfront, especially because of the bid/ask spreads and the lack of liquidity in deep ITM options. While extrinsic value might be low, the absolute dollar cost is very high. Also, the move required to overcome the combined cost of both options is usually much larger than the 3.7% you mention, especially after factoring in commissions, slippage, and the fact that one side will lose intrinsic value as the underlying moves. You might be better off using ATM straddles or strangles for volatility bets, or even looking at ratio spreads if you're expecting larger moves. ... score: 0.18918

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Interesting approach! The idea of using deep ITM strangles to capitalize on volatility definitely has some merit since deep ITM options carry a lot of intrinsic value and less extrinsic premium decay. However, one concern is that you’re essentially paying a hefty price upfront because deep ITM options are expensive. Your breakeven points might be quite far apart, meaning the underlying asset needs to move significantly in either direction to cover those costs and generate profit. Also, if the market moves but then retraces, you could get stuck with losses on one leg that outweigh gains on the other. So, while it’s good for capturing big moves, the risk is that you’re paying for a volatility premium that might not materialize in a way that covers both contracts’ cost. ... score: 0.29111

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've been following your posts for a while now, and I must say, your enthusiasm for trading is infectious. However, I have to advise you to be cautious with this deep ITM strangle spread. While it's true that the extrinsic value paid is limited to about 3.7%, you're forgetting one crucial aspect: the time decay. As the days go by, the time value of the options will decrease, which means your potential profit will be reduced. Moreover, the fact that both contracts are deep in the money doesn't necessarily mean that the trade is risk-free. You're still exposed to the underlying asset's price movements, and if the market doesn't move in the direction you're expecting, you could end up losing money. I'm not saying it's a bad trade per se, but you need to carefully consider the risks involved and adjust your strategy accordingly. It's great that you're doing your due diligence, and I'd love to discuss this further with you. ... score: 0.32427

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: While a deep ITM strangle spread can potentially be profitable during volatile market conditions, there are several risks and factors to consider. Firstly, even though both options are deep ITM, the extrinsic value can still erode over time due to theta decay, especially if the market doesn't move as expected. Secondly, while having both deltas around 1 initially can provide some protection, it's essential to remember that delta is not constant and can change rapidly with market movements. Consequently, if the market moves against your position, your losses can accumulate quickly. Lastly, keep in mind that options trading involves substantial risk, including the potential for significant losses. Always ensure you understand the risks and have a well-defined exit strategy. ... score: 0.34193

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: A great trade idea, but it's important to consider a few potential pitfalls. While deep ITM strangle spreads can indeed limit your extrinsic value paid, the market's volatility can also work against you. One major risk is the potential for a significant market move that could push both legs out of the money. For instance, if the market experiences a sudden and extreme drop or spike, the strangle could lose value rapidly, especially as expiration approaches. Additionally, while the delta of both legs might start around 1, the gamma of these options can cause the delta to change rapidly, especially if the underlying asset moves significantly. This can lead to unexpected losses if the market moves in a direction you didn't anticipate. It's also worth considering the impact of implied volatility (IV) on your trade. If IV drops, the value of your options can decrease, even if the underlying asset price remains favorable. In summary, while the trade has potential, it's crucial to monitor market conditions and have a solid risk management plan in place. ... score: 0.36613
