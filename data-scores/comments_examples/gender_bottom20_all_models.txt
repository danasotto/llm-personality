Post: Gutenberg or Classic editor?
I'm getting back into frontend development after many years and feel a bit out of touch.

Is the Gutenberg editor now the standard way of working with WordPress, or do people still commonly use the classic editor? I hated the look of Gutenberg when it first came out, but now Im starting to see some benefit of it.

Reddit author comment: Before I left WP behind I was an outspoken supporter of Gutenberg, we used it in production before it was introduced to core and, from a developer perspective, it's more flexible and performant than any shortcode based editor, if you're willing to dive into the weird react-with-wrappers world of making custom blocks.

Honestly at that point just learn real react and make websites with that. Matt Mullenweg nuked what remained of the dying community and anyone with sense is moving on to other platforms ASAP. I worked at a WP agency for years, I'm not a hater, it's just time to go. ... score: 0.0

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been doing WordPress development for about 8 years now, and honestly, Gutenberg has become pretty much the standard at this point. When it first launched in 2018, yeah, it was rough around the edges and a lot of developers (myself included) were pretty resistant to it. But WordPress has really refined it over the years, and the block-based approach actually makes a lot of sense once you get used to it. Most of my clients now expect the modern editing experience that Gutenberg provides, especially when they see how easy it is to create complex layouts without touching code. The Classic Editor plugin is still maintained and gets regular updates, so it's not going anywhere soon, but I'd definitely recommend getting comfortable with Gutenberg if you're jumping back into WordPress development. The Full Site Editing features they've been rolling out are pretty impressive too, and that's all built on the block editor foundation. Plus, if you're doing any custom development, the block development tools have gotten really solid. ... score: 0.42757

gpt4.1-instruct comment: As someone who's been building WordPress sites for clients over the past few years, I can confirm that Gutenberg (now called the "block editor") really has become the default for most new projects. When it first launched, a lot of us stuck with the Classic Editor plugin because the block interface felt clunky and limited, but it's improved dramatically since then. Now, many themes and plugins are designed specifically for Gutenberg compatibility, and features like full site editing are only possible within the block editor ecosystem. That said, there are still niche use cases or legacy sites where Classic makes sense, especially for people who want a super simple editing experience. But if you're getting back into frontend work, I'd recommend embracing Gutenberg—it opens up a lot of creative possibilities, especially if you learn to build your own blocks! ... score: 0.53719

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey! I was in the same boat a while back, coming back to WordPress after some years away. Gutenberg is definitely the official standard now—WordPress has been pushing it hard since version 5.0, and most new themes and plugins are built with block compatibility in mind. That said, the Classic Editor is still widely used, especially among developers and content creators who prefer a more straightforward, traditional interface or have legacy workflows. Personally, I found Gutenberg’s initial release a bit clunky, but after using it more, I appreciate the flexibility it offers with blocks and layout control without needing to dive into code constantly. Plus, the ecosystem around blocks is growing rapidly, so you can create really dynamic pages without extra plugins. If you’re getting back into frontend development, learning to build custom blocks can be a great skill, too. But if you want simplicity and are maintaining older projects, Classic Editor plugins still hold plenty of value. Ultimately, it depends on what kind of projects you’re working on and your comfort with the new paradigm. ... score: 0.54556

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm a bit biased, but I think Gutenberg is the way to go, I was skeptical at first, but once I got used to it, I found it to be so much more intuitive and user-friendly than the classic editor, the block-based system makes it easy to create complex layouts and designs without needing to know how to code, and the fact that it's now the default editor for WordPress means that it's getting more support and updates, which is important for security and compatibility, I've noticed that many plugins and themes are now optimized for Gutenberg, which is a big plus. ... score: 0.28836

While it initially faced criticism, it's now widely accepted due to its block-based approach, which allows for more flexible and customizable layouts. However, many still prefer the classic editor for its simplicity and familiarity. It's all about personal preference and project requirements. ... score: 0.66649

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I totally feel you! I was initially resistant to Gutenberg when it first launched, but over time, I’ve come to appreciate its flexibility and power. It’s definitely become the standard for most WordPress sites, especially with the constant updates and new features. The block-based system allows for a lot more creativity and control over the layout, which is a huge plus. However, the classic editor is still available and some plugins and themes still support it. If you’re just getting back into it, I’d recommend giving Gutenberg a try. There are a lot of resources and tutorials out there to help you get up to speed.

Post: Where can I get plus sized clothes for an Indian wedding that is happening next week
Waited till the last minute and I am stressed. I would be wearing a sari or anything adjacent, and I wear a size xxl in women's sizes. Where are your favorite places to shop for formal Indian clothes? 

Reddit author comment: Fellow big girl here! I’ve found I have more luck with shalwar kameez sets and anarkali dresses than I do with saree; my belly is too jiggly and my chest too big to really rock the cropped backless choli, and so many of them come unfinished and have to be sewn for your body. Also, I am not good at the pleats and I never feel secure in saree.

Post: I want a Hedge, but which one? Bush suggestions?
I have this space in my property. Right now it's pretty underused. This is where, once upon a time, the property had a garage; that's gone now. All that's left is a driveway, they removed the cement floor too. So I'm thinking about a wild flower and semi naturalized space. Eventually I want to fence it in, like the rest of the yard. Till then, hedges! I'm in Ohio, USA. Zone 7a/6b. I have stupid heavy deer pressure. The space is mostly sunny but along the rear is some shade. We have privet at the side (I didn't plant it) and it's a lot of upkeep. I planted some smaller barberry bushes along the front. Ideally, I'd like something that tops out around six feet tall (a little bit taller is ok) and is deer resistant and semi-shade friendly.

What would you suggest?

Reddit author comment: There have been a few good suggestions. While I like the idea of all natives, it's probably not going to happen. Deer pressure and the need for a solid-ish hedge rule some of the suggestions out. What I'm currently considering (some have cultivar names, some don't:

* Fragrant Mohawk Viburnum
* Prairie Ninebark
* Carolina spicebush
* French Pink Pussy Willow
* Viburnum dentatum
* 'Spice Girl' Koreanspice Viburnum
* Witchhazel (a bit bigger but a single one would look nice as part of a hedge)
* Lynwood Gold Yellow Bells Forsythia
* Aphrodite Sweetshrub (Carolina Allspice)
* American Beautyberry
* Illicium floridanum 'Grey Ghost' (I really like this one!) 

Any feedback, other than telling me to yoink the already planted hedges? ... score: 0.00121

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: **u/GardenGuru2024**: Given your requirements and that heavy deer pressure in Ohio, I'd strongly recommend looking into ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius). It checks all your boxes - deer resistant, tolerates partial shade, gets to about 6-8 feet tall, and is native to Ohio so it'll thrive in your climate zone. The cultivars like 'Diablo' or 'Summer Wine' have gorgeous foliage color that changes seasonally, and they produce clusters of white flowers in spring followed by interesting seed pods. They're also much lower maintenance than privet - basically just an annual pruning to shape them up. Another excellent option would be spicebush (Lindera benzoin) which is also native, deer resistant, and does well in partial shade. It won't get quite as tall (4-6 feet typically) but it has beautiful yellow fall color and the berries feed birds. Both of these will work well with your wildflower naturalized vision and won't require the constant trimming that makes privet such a pain. Plus, going native means you're supporting local wildlife while keeping those pesky deer away from your hedge! ... score: 0.98416

gpt4.1-instruct comment: First off, this sounds like a really fun project! Since you’re in Ohio with heavy deer pressure and some shade, I’d definitely avoid tender shrubs like arborvitae, as deer absolutely love them. You mentioned you already have privet (which can get invasive) and barberry (which is deer-proof, but also invasive in a lot of areas). If you’re looking for something a bit more wildlife-friendly and less maintenance, I’d suggest looking into viburnums, specifically Arrowwood Viburnum (Viburnum dentatum). They’re native, handle a range of sun/shade, top out around 6-10 feet, and deer tend to leave them alone. Another good option is Ilex glabra (Inkberry), which is evergreen, deer-resistant, and does well in part shade. You might also check out Fothergilla or Ninebark (Physocarpus opulifolius)—both are tough, have lovely blooms, and are generally deer-resistant. Mixing a few types will give you a more natural look, plus seasonal interest! Just make sure whatever you choose is not invasive in your area, since Ohio is cracking down on a lot of non-native hedges. Good luck—would love to see updates as it grows in! ... score: 0.00269

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey! Given your zone and the heavy deer pressure, I’d recommend looking into native shrubs that deer tend to avoid and that can handle partial shade. One great option is American holly (Ilex opaca) – it’s evergreen, deer-resistant, and can be pruned to stay around 6 feet. Plus, the glossy leaves and red berries add year-round interest. Another good pick is inkberry holly (Ilex glabra), which is a bit more tolerant of wet soil and shade, and also deer-resistant. If you want something flowering, try Virginia sweetspire (Itea virginica); it’s native, deer-resistant, loves part shade, and has beautiful white cascading flowers in spring. For a bit of color and texture, spicebush (Lindera benzoin) is excellent too, with fragrant leaves and yellow flowers. All of these will require less maintenance than privet and barberry, and they’ll support local wildlife. Just make sure to mulch well and water during establishment! ... score: 0.99926

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a seasoned gardener, I must say that I'm excited to help you with your hedge conundrum. Given your requirements, I think you should consider a mix of shrubs that are not only deer-resistant but also provide a beautiful display of flowers, foliage, or berries. For a sunny spot, I'd recommend the 'Korean Lilac' (Syringa 'Palibin'), which is a compact, flowering shrub that grows up to 6 feet tall and is known to be deer-resistant. Another option could be the 'Red Twig Dogwood' (Cornus sericea), which provides stunning winter interest with its bright red stems and can tolerate partial shade. If you're looking for something with a more natural, wild look, you could consider the 'American Beautyberry' (Callicarpa americana), which produces vibrant purple berries in the fall and can grow up to 6 feet tall. Since you mentioned you have privet, which can be a bit high-maintenance, you might want to consider a low-maintenance alternative like the 'Inkberry Holly' (Ilex glabra), which has glossy, dark green leaves and can tolerate a range of light conditions. Lastly, keep in mind that it's essential to choose plants that are suitable for your USDA Hardiness Zone (7a/6b) to ensure they thrive in your area. I hope these suggestions help you find the perfect hedge for your property. ... score: 0.99407

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Greetings from a fellow Ohioan! It sounds like you're looking for a hedge that's both deer-resistant and shade-friendly. I've had great success with American Arborvitae (Thuja occidentalis) in my own garden. They're evergreen, so they'll provide year-round interest, and they can grow up to 15 feet tall, but you can keep them trimmed to around 6 feet. They're also hardy in zones 3-8, so they should do well in your area. Another option could be Inkberry Holly (Ilex glabra). They're also evergreen and deer-resistant, and they can tolerate partial shade. They typically grow to about 8 feet tall, but there are dwarf varieties available if you want something a bit smaller.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Absolutely love the idea of a naturalized space in your yard! For a hedge that fits your criteria, I would highly recommend the **Arrowwood Viburnum (Viburnum dentatum)**. It's a fantastic choice for Ohio, especially in Zone 7a/6b. This shrub can grow up to 6-10 feet tall, which is perfect for your height needs. It's also quite deer-resistant, which is crucial given the heavy deer pressure you mentioned. Arrowwood Viburnum thrives in both full sun and partial shade, making it a versatile option for your space. It has attractive, dark green foliage that turns a beautiful reddish-purple in the fall, adding a pop of color to your yard. Additionally, it produces small, white flowers in the spring, followed by blue-black berries that attract birds, enhancing the natural feel of your garden. It's relatively low maintenance compared to privet and doesn't require as much pruning. Another benefit is that it's a native plant, which means it's well-adapted to the local climate and soil conditions. Overall, it's a win-win for a beautiful, functional, and low-maintenance hedge. ... score: 0.13053

Post: Bookclub and Sources Wednesday!
Hi everybody,

Welcome to our weekly book recommendation thread!

We have found that a lot of people come to this sub to ask for books about history or sources on certain topics. Others make posts about a book they themselves have read and want to share their thoughts about it with the rest of the sub.

We thought it would be a good idea to try and bundle these posts together a bit. One big weekly post where everybody can ask for books or (re)sources on any historic subject or timeperiod, or to share books they recently discovered or read. Giving opinions or asking about their factuality is encouraged!

Of course it’s not limited to \*just\* books; podcasts, videos, etc. are also welcome. As a reminder,  also has a recommended list of things to read, listen to or watch

Reddit author comment: I finished Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War by Louis Menand this week.

If any of you read the Metaphysical Club about a decade ago, you’ll have a good idea what this book is like. I really enjoyed it. I like intellectual histories. This book starts right off the bat with a discussion of James Burnham and George Orwell, which is a topic I’m fascinated with. It covers the growing awareness in the left and right of the post war USSR’s aims and goals and how the foreign policy establishment and intellectuals were reacting to that. Menand also covers the big movements in philosophy, literary criticism, visual arts, film, music, and dance. 

Menand does a good job of running through an extremely productive intellectual period and talks about how the GI Bill fueled a growth of intellectualism within the US and how products like the New Yorker grew to fill marketing opportunities presented by this new class of intellectuals. He also does a good job of explaining how refugee populations had more of an influence in areas like music than they did in visual arts. 

I don’t think I’ve ever come across anything from Menand that I wouldn’t recommend. If you’re even mildly curious, I would recommend this. It seems like it's kind of hefty at around 700 pages, but Menand is a great writer and the topics, even when I didn't care much like the section about dance, tied into enough other important cultural things that I still flew through the chapters. ... score: 0.00256

As someone who's always been intimidated by military history, Tuchman's writing style makes the complex political maneuvering and strategic decisions leading up to WWI incredibly accessible.

The way she describes the domino effect of mobilization orders and how quickly Europe stumbled into total war is both fascinating and terrifying.

Post: Zero Day - hard to watch
I have a hard time watching this show post inauguration because real world american politics are WAY MORE bat-shit crazy now. 

Maybe, if the show dropped like 6 weeks earlier and before the real-world shitshow started, it might have been different (for me, at least).

What do you think?

Reddit author comment: "Project Blue Beam" is a conspiracy fiction book published in 1994. What it describes is a False Flag Gaslight technique used by the government to polarize the population.

9/11 was the first use of this Republican Dirty Trick. Bin Laden was a CIA trained operative and a Sunni Islam Saudi Arabian. All 19 of the hijackers were Sunni Islam Arabs, most Saudi Arabian. It had to be an inside job because there was too much inside information about which planes would have full fuel tanks, when they were scheduled to be in the air, what their routes were. It was too precise for it to not have been a CIA planned operation.

In 2003, Republican President George W. Bush used this technique again, a False Flag Gaslighting of the American public on the "grave threat to national security" of Aluminum Tubes and Yellow Cake, lying to the United Nations about their "threat". Dave Chappelle could see through that BS back then.

I was actually really looking forward to Zero Day when it was first announced, but watching it now feels almost quaint compared to what's happening in real life. Like, the show's political machinations and crisis scenarios feel almost tame when you've got actual politicians doing things that would seem too over-the-top for fiction just a few years ago. It's that weird phenomenon where reality has become so absurd that fictional drama can't compete. I think timing really is everything with political thrillers - they need to feel like a heightened version of reality, not a watered-down one. The show probably would have hit different if it came out during a more "normal" political climate, but now it just feels like watching a less chaotic version of the news.

Reddit author comment: [Tactical Barbell Mass Protocol: Grey Man-Cycle 2, Week 1, Day 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAJrPybVXZk&pp=ygUGRW1ldmFz) was the best one yet, with me hitting 5x8x395 on the trap bar and 5x8x196 on the axle bench before getting in my circuit of belt squats, dips and curls.  Back and hips are really feeling in a good way.


Sadly, no food porn for today, you’ll just have to settle for the description of Operation Conan.  Last night we went Bavarian…esque.  For the Wife and the Kiddo, we had some soft pretzels to go along with some sausages (which I’m going to offend my Bavarian/German/Austrian audience when I admit that, for the kiddo, it was a Hebrew national hotdog).  Mrs is using “Factor” meal prep, and with that got some bison, pork, cheddar jalapeno sausages as a protein add on, so I grilled those up, and also threw in some Teton Waters grassfed beef polish sausages and some of those organic grassfed hot dogs I like, all 3 of which I put on my plate, alongside 3 pastured sunny side up eggs, grassfed cottage cheese and pork cracklin’.  I ended up having 1 more hot dog after this.  I REALLY think that the cottage cheese is a fantastic lever for mass gain.  It’s cheese, yes, which makes it hyperpalatable to me, but it’s so jacked up in protein compared to conventional cheeses that I feel it alters ratios in a beneficial way.  I’m still trying not to overconsume it, but adding it to every meal seems to be working well. ... score: 0.01961

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey everyone! I've been lurking on this sub for a while and finally decided to start my fitness journey seriously. I'm a complete beginner (28M, 5'10", around 160lbs) and honestly feeling pretty overwhelmed by all the information out there. I've read through the FAQ like three times now, but I'm still confused about one thing - how do I know if I should focus on cutting or bulking first? I'm what I'd call "skinny fat" - not much muscle mass but I do have some belly fat that bothers me. Some people say to cut first to get lean, others say to bulk to build a foundation of muscle. I've been doing some basic bodyweight exercises for about a month now (push-ups, squats, planks) but I know I need to get more serious about it. Should I join a gym? Is it worth investing in a home setup instead? My budget is pretty tight as a recent college grad, but I'm willing to prioritize this if it means getting results. Any advice for someone just starting out would be really appreciated! ... score: 0.70068

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Honestly, I love these simple question threads because sometimes the stuff I want to ask feels way too basic for a full post, but I know I’m not the only one who wonders. For example, I’ve always been confused about the difference between all the types of protein powders—whey, casein, plant-based, etc.—and which one is actually best for someone just starting out at the gym. I keep reading different opinions online and it gets overwhelming. Has anyone found that one type actually helped them more with muscle gain or recovery? Or is it just about getting enough protein overall? Would love to hear real experiences instead of just marketing hype! ... score: 0.41371

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I really appreciate having a thread like this where no question feels too small or silly to ask. When I first started trying to gain lean mass, I was overwhelmed by all the conflicting advice out there—should I focus on protein timing, how many carbs to eat, or just hit the gym hard? Having a place to ask basic questions without judgment is super helpful. For anyone starting out, my biggest tip is consistency over perfection. Don’t stress if you miss a day or two; just keep going. Also, remember that recovery and sleep are just as important as lifting and nutrition. Looking forward to seeing what questions everyone has today! ... score: 0.26866

I've been trying to gain some lean mass, but I feel like I'm not seeing the results I want. I've been doing a mix of cardio and weightlifting, 3 days a week for about an hour each time. Is this enough? Should I be focusing more on one type of exercise over the other? Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated! ... score: 0.77588

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Sure, I can help with that! The phrase "break a leg" is indeed a bit odd, but it has a few possible origins. One theory is that it's a superstitious way to avoid jinxing a performance. In theater, it's believed that wishing someone good luck directly could actually bring bad luck, so saying something negative is a way to trick fate. Another theory is that it comes from the practice of bowing, where performers would bend their legs (or "break" them) at the knee. So, "break a leg" could be a way of saying "take a bow" or "get a lot of applause." There are a few other explanations, but these are the most common ones. It's a fun bit of theater trivia! 😊 ... score: 0.9297

Post: Can Arnis / Eskrima techniques be applied using forearms?
Would it be viable to adapt arnis/eskrima techniques to strike with the forearms (provided they are conditioned) instead of using a stick or knife? By viable I mean in empty hand combat. If it is viable, what martial arts should I learn along with that to supplement?

Reddit author comment: Why reinvent the wheel? There is going to be a variety of crossover to all martial arts, and depending on your skill level of interest, more or less. As being top elite in a specific competition will tend to reduce some crossover that works for generic training and a avg "foot soldier" level person. 


Just take any unarmed art that has functional reality and it'll all track well enough. You're not going to be a better fighter doing sword/stick strikes with your forearm, than if you know how to punch. 


Either take the associated art unarmed combat as FMA has. Or take like Muay Thai or another kickboxing. 


Or take Judo/BJJ and learn grappling, which translates great to real weapon fights and allows you to use strikes as set up/opener to the grappling. ... score: 0.04684

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely! This is actually a pretty common adaptation that many FMA practitioners explore. The biomechanics of stick and blade work translate surprisingly well to forearm strikes, especially the angles of attack and flow patterns. Your forearms essentially become your weapons, and the same 12 angles of attack in most Eskrima systems work great with forearm conditioning. However, you'll want to be careful about range - sticks give you extended reach that forearms obviously don't, so you'll need to adjust your distance management. For supplementary arts, I'd highly recommend Muay Thai for the clinch work and elbow techniques, plus some Panantukan (Filipino boxing) if you can find it, since it's specifically designed as the empty-hand component of FMA. Silat also pairs beautifully with this approach since it emphasizes similar flowing movements and limb destruction concepts. Just make sure you're conditioning your forearms properly - start light and build up gradually, or you'll end up with some nasty injuries that'll set back your training. ... score: 0.46225

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, a lot of Arnis/Eskrima techniques can be adapted to use the forearms, especially in empty hand combat scenarios. Many Filipino martial arts (FMA) systems have what’s called “panantukan” or “dirty boxing,” which is essentially the empty hand adaptation of their stick and blade movements. The motions you learn with a stick (angles, deflections, redirections) can be mirrored with your arms, and forearm strikes can be very effective, especially in close quarters. Forearm shots can be used for blocking, parrying, and striking (think hammerfist, ridge hand, or elbow-like motions). To supplement your training, you might want to look into Muay Thai for its clinch work and elbow/forearm strikes, or even boxing for its hand and arm mechanics. Kali/Arnis instructors who focus on the “empty hand” side of things (like Panantukan or Dumog) would be perfect, as they often bridge the gap between weapon and empty hand applications. Just make sure your forearms are conditioned properly to avoid injury! ... score: 0.91453

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Absolutely, adapting Arnis/Eskrima techniques to forearm strikes can be viable in empty-hand combat, especially if your forearms are well-conditioned. Traditional Arnis emphasizes weapon-based movement, angles, and timing, which can translate effectively to forearm strikes, blocks, and parries. The forearm can be used for powerful blocks, checks, and even offensive strikes, mimicking the stick’s linear motions but with added versatility since it’s part of your body. To supplement this, learning arts like Muay Thai for clinch work and conditioning, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for grappling transitions, and perhaps Filipino Martial Arts empty-hand systems like Panantukan (Filipino boxing) could round out your skill set. Panantukan specifically bridges the gap between weapon-based and empty-hand combat, focusing on similar angles, traps, and strikes with hands and forearms. Conditioning is key, so incorporating forearm strengthening exercises and impact conditioning drills would enhance the effectiveness. Overall, blending Eskrima principles with forearm strikes is not only viable but can create a unique and effective empty-hand fighting style. ... score: 0.71536

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the idea of adapting martial arts techniques to empty-hand combat, and using forearms in Arnis/Eskrima is an intriguing concept. The key to successfully applying these techniques would be to condition the forearms to withstand the impact, as well as to develop the proper technique and timing. It's essential to note that the forearms are not as durable as sticks or knives, so the strikes would need to be more precise and controlled. In terms of supplementing with other martial arts, I would recommend learning Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to improve grappling skills, as well as Muay Thai or Boxing to enhance striking techniques. By combining these martial arts, you could create a unique and effective fighting style that incorporates the principles of Arnis/Eskrima with the practicality of empty-hand combat. ... score: 0.19439

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Comment 1: While Arnis and Eskrima are traditionally stick and knife fighting styles, many of the principles can be adapted for empty-hand combat. The forearm strikes you're suggesting could be a viable option, especially if you're looking for a way to condition your arms. However, keep in mind that without the added reach and leverage of a weapon, the dynamics of combat change significantly. You'll need to focus on footwork, evasion, and grappling techniques to make up for the lack of a weapon. I suggest looking into Filipino martial arts that focus on empty-hand combat, like Panantukan or Dumog, to supplement your practice. ... score: 0.38235

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Forearm strikes can definitely be effective, but it's important to understand the biomechanics and risks involved. In Arnis/Eskrima, the stick serves as an extension of the arm, providing leverage and reach. When using your forearms, you lose some of that leverage, so you need to focus on generating power from your core and hips. I'd recommend checking out arts like Krav Maga or Systema, which both emphasize practical, no-nonsense techniques for self-defense. These systems can teach you how to deliver powerful strikes and defend against various attacks. Also, consider incorporating some boxing or kickboxing to improve your overall striking abilities and footwork. ... score: 0.0

I'm a complete beginner when it comes to fitness and I'm honestly feeling pretty overwhelmed by all the information out there. I'm 28, pretty sedentary lifestyle due to my desk job, and I want to start building some muscle and getting stronger. I've read through parts of the FAQ but I'm still confused about a few things. First, how do I know if I should be eating in a surplus or deficit? I'm not overweight but I'm definitely what you'd call "skinny fat" - no muscle definition and a bit of belly fat. Second, is it really necessary to track every single thing I eat? That seems incredibly tedious and I'm worried I'll burn out quickly if I try to be too precise right from the start.

It's a great way to break down barriers and create a supportive environment where people feel comfortable sharing their thoughts and ideas. I also appreciate the emphasis on providing details when asking a question, as it really does help to get more accurate and helpful responses. I've been in situations where I've asked a question and gotten a response that was way off base, only to realize later that I hadn't provided enough context or information.

I feel like I could do more but I know it's difficult to say. I'm not planning on buying a car or a house anytime soon but Idk yet how the "not anymore teenage life" looks like and maybe there will happen things that I didn't plan (I hope you get what I mean)
• Are the ETF's I picked good for me? (Ik this is also hard to tell)

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: **u/MarketWatcher2025**: Been thinking a lot about the current market environment and wanted to share some observations. We're seeing some interesting divergences between growth and value stocks lately, especially in the tech sector. While the mega-caps have been relatively stable, there's been significant rotation into smaller cap names that were beaten down last year. I've been gradually increasing my position in international developed markets through VEA and VXUS, as the dollar strength seems to be moderating and valuations overseas look more attractive. The yield curve dynamics are also worth watching - we're seeing some normalization but it's still not entirely healthy. For those looking at sector allocation, I'd suggest keeping an eye on healthcare and utilities as potential defensive plays if we see increased volatility.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I’ve noticed there’s been a lot of talk lately about what might happen with interest rates in 2025, especially since the Fed’s tone has shifted a bit. For anyone just starting out, it’s really important to understand how these rate changes can impact everything from stocks to bonds to real estate. Higher rates usually mean borrowing gets more expensive, which can slow down economic growth but also creates opportunities in bonds (yields go up!). For long-term investors, I’d say don’t get too caught up in the short-term noise. Diversifying your portfolio and keeping your investment horizon in mind is still the best strategy, in my opinion.

Post: Asymmetric grandparents, in-laws uninterested
Anybody else with one set of grandparents who are just kind of duds? My in-laws say they want to see our kids and clearly take pride in being grandparents, but whenever they're here they just kind of dawdle around in the orbit of our children and only seem to have motivation to *be* grandparents sporadically.

We have a 3 year old and a set of twins who are ~10 months, so it definitely can be a lot to be around them at times, but their other grandparents (my parents) are always super hands-on and asking when they can get more time and what they can do to help.

My wife has noticed the difference, it clearly bothers her, and I don't know what to do about it. Frankly, it bugs the shit out of me, but I don't want to pile on or feed into a negative cycle, so I just try to frame it as them trying their best while validating that I've noticed it.

Anybody been in a similar situation and how did it pan out?



Reddit author comment: My dad absolutely adores our two boys, but when he flew across the country to visit us a year and a half ago, I swear he spent 90% of the time just sitting on our couch staring at his phone. He missed several dinners with us because he was passed out on the couch asleep. It was like pulling teeth getting him to actually come out of the house and do things with us (He's in his late 60s but uses the "I'm old" excuse like he in his 80s), and he kept trying to put the tv on (when we said no more tv) so our boys would leave their playroom and some sit in the living room with him. It was actually really disappointing. I remember my grandpa making picnics with me, playing board games with me, taking me to fun places when we'd visit.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, this hits so close to home it's almost painful to read. We've been dealing with this exact dynamic for about 5 years now with our two kids. My parents are the hands-on ones - they're constantly asking to babysit, they remember every little milestone, they actually get down on the floor and play with the kids. Meanwhile, my husband's parents show up, sit on the couch, maybe hold the baby for like 10 minutes if we literally place the child in their arms, and then just... exist. They'll say things like "oh we should see the grandkids more" but when we invite them over or suggest activities, there's always some excuse or they come but act like they're doing us this huge favor. The worst part is watching my kids notice the difference as they get older. My 7-year-old has started asking why Grandma and Grandpa [my parents] always want to play but the other grandparents just watch TV. It's heartbreaking honestly.

We tried inviting them to specific activities, like reading a book or helping with snack time, instead of just asking them to “spend time.” Sometimes having clear roles or little tasks helped them engage more, but ultimately, we’ve just accepted that the involvement will never be symmetrical.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from. We have a similar dynamic with my in-laws and my own parents. My parents are constantly involved, offering to babysit, bringing over meals, and genuinely excited to engage with the kids. Meanwhile, my in-laws seem to show up more out of obligation or for short visits and don’t really step up much beyond that. It’s tough because you want your kids to have meaningful relationships with all grandparents, but it feels like you’re forcing it with the less engaged side. What helped us was having an honest conversation (gently) with the in-laws about what kind of support or involvement would actually mean a lot to us and the kids. Sometimes people don’t realize how their actions come across or what’s expected of them. It didn’t turn everything around overnight, but it opened the door for more intentional visits and activities. Also, focusing on quality over quantity—like suggesting specific outings or routines—can help.

One thing that worked for us was having an open and honest conversation with my in-laws, explaining how their behavior was affecting us and the kids. It wasn't easy, but it helped to clear the air and understand their perspective. They had been dealing with some personal issues that we weren't aware of, and once we knew what was going on, we were able to be more supportive and understanding. It's not always easy to initiate these conversations, but sometimes it's necessary to address the elephant in the room and work towards a solution. My advice would be to approach the conversation with empathy and try to avoid being confrontational, as that can lead to more harm than good. ... score: 0.65126

They've tried to step up a bit, but it's still not the same. I think the key is to keep the lines of communication open and keep trying to find common ground. It's a delicate balance, but it's worth it for the sake of the kids and the family dynamic.

Post: Hardest trails within a 2-3 hour drive of Philadelphia?
Me and my friend have been doing hiking trips for a while now, and we have another coming up soon and I’m in charge of planning the hike. Me and him like more difficult trails and typically the most difficult/hardest haven’t been anything hard, just typically a little narrower or longer distance. So I want to find an actually hard trail that we can do and take. So I want to know if anyone knows any hard or treacherous trails within a 2-3 hour drive of Philadelphia? (3 hours max)

Also side note: why are hard trails easy to do with no break but the second you get on the paved trail back to the parking lot, you’re legs just give out and you feel like this paved road is harder than the trail?

Reddit author comment: Glen Onokos Falls but I believe the trail is closed to the public. However, I believe it was closed to the public last time I went back in 2020 and you definitely couldn't tell with the amount of people who were there hiking it. Things may have changed since then though.

EDIT: Also wanted to add a two more suggestions.

World's End State Park. I don't remember the names of the specific trails but I hike a few about 10 years ago and remember them being pretty difficult, at least for trails in PA.

Rickett's Glen State Park. Once again, don't remember trail names but just hiking down and up the main water falls trail is pretty intense, and quite rewarding. ... score: 0.09277

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Dude, you NEED to check out the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock loop in Berks County - it's about 1.5 hours from Philly and will absolutely kick your ass. The trail itself is around 8.5 miles with some seriously steep, rocky sections that'll have you scrambling over boulders. What makes it brutal isn't just the distance, but the constant elevation changes and the fact that the trail is basically just rocks for long stretches. Your ankles will be screaming by the end. The views are incredible though - totally worth the pain. If you want something even more challenging, try doing it in reverse or add on the side trail to the Hamburg Reservoir for extra miles. Fair warning though, the descent can be harder than the ascent because of all the loose rock. And to answer your side note - it's because your muscles are already fatigued and the hard pavement doesn't absorb impact like dirt trails do, so your legs are basically getting pounded with every step when they're already toast! ... score: 0.13616

gpt4.1-instruct comment: If you’re looking for a real challenge within a 2-3 hour drive of Philly, I’d recommend checking out the Devil’s Path in the Catskills, NY. It’s right around that 3-hour mark, but it’s notorious for being one of the toughest hikes in the Northeast. The whole thing is about 24 miles with around 9,000 feet of elevation gain, but you can do a shorter section (like the western half) if you’re not up for the full trek. It’s super rugged, with lots of steep ascents and descents, scrambles, and some exposure. Locally, the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock loop (near Hamburg, PA) isn’t as long or hard, but it’s got some good climbs and rocky terrain. As for the paved trail thing, I think it’s a mental shift—you’re in “go mode” on the rugged stuff, but the second you hit the pavement your brain knows you’re almost done and lets your guard down, so all the fatigue hits at once! ... score: 0.22025

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: If you’re looking for genuinely challenging trails within a 2-3 hour radius of Philly, you might want to check out the Pinnacle Trail in the Delaware Water Gap. It’s not only steep and rocky but also offers some exposed sections that can test your scrambling skills. Another option is the Appalachian Trail sections near Hawk Mountain or the Lehigh Gorge Trail, where you can combine elevation changes with rugged terrain. For something a bit more remote and wild, portions of the Loyalsock State Forest trails in PA are notoriously tough with a lot of elevation gain and uneven footing. As for your side note about paved trails feeling harder after a hike, it’s actually pretty common—your leg muscles get used to the uneven, varied terrain on the trail, engaging stabilizers and different muscle groups. When you switch to flat pavement, those muscles don’t get the same engagement, and your legs can feel fatigued or awkward, making it seem harder even though the surface is easier. Also, downhill on pavement can be surprisingly tough on your knees and quads, which might add to that feeling. Hope you find a trail that really challenges you guys! ... score: 0.41395

The Appalachian Trail (AT) has some sections that are particularly challenging within a 2-3 hour drive of Philadelphia. The section near Hawk Mountain Sanctuary in Pennsylvania is known for its steep climbs and rocky terrain. Another great option is the Lenape Trail in New Jersey, which has some very steep sections and is known for its rugged beauty. Both of these trails will definitely give you a good workout and keep you on your toes. As for your side note, I totally get what you mean. The pavement can feel like a completely different challenge after you’ve been on uneven terrain for a while. It’s all about the sudden change in surface and the way your muscles have to adjust. Your legs are already tired, and the smooth, unyielding surface of the pavement can feel jarring and more exhausting. Hope you have a great hike! 🌄 ... score: 0.6097

Post: Portable cell signal boosters?
Anyone know of any good portable cell signal boosters I can take with me out into the woods? When I’m out there I can often get one tiny bar of LTE which from my understanding is all you need for a booster to work. I’m not looking for a satellite connection or anything as  I’ve already got an Inreach. I’m just talking about boosting cell signal.

Reddit author comment: Someone posted this recently and has great information. 

https://www.lengthytravel.com/hiking-the-appalachian-trail-getting-the-best-mobile-phone-service/

Check it out. It'll reveal things you didn't know. 

Also the signal bars on modern smart phones are fake and shouldn't be used anymore. It's not measuring anything real. Each device and OS has its own algorithm on calculating the "data" it uses. 

Signal strength is measured in decibel-milliwatts (dBm). Usually represented in a negative number. The closer to zero, the better th signal. There's a lot of variables from the carrier, service, and device that play major roles which is part of why bars are obsolete. The real reason we have bars on our screen is because older technology when phones came out were more like radio repeater devices than a digital microwave networking system. Humans dont like change. No one understood decibel-milliwatts. 

Now that Ive been on this post, I cannot Google anything cellphone signal related without Cell Phone Booster Ads being force fed into my results. Yesterday morning when I googled this topic, a lot more refined results came in and didn't flood my searches with "buy our signal booster". Weird. ... score: 0.10211

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been using the WeBoost Drive Reach RV for about two years now and it's been a game-changer for my camping trips. While it's technically designed for RVs, I've found it works great as a portable solution if you have a way to power it (I use a Jackery power station). The key thing you mentioned about having that one bar is absolutely correct - boosters are amplifiers, not signal creators, so they need something to work with. In my experience, the Drive Reach can take that weak signal and boost it enough to get reliable data and calls. The setup is pretty straightforward: you need the booster unit, an external antenna (I mount mine on a telescoping pole), an internal antenna, and coax cables to connect everything. The whole system draws about 2-3 amps, so it's not too power-hungry. One thing to keep in mind is that the FCC requires these boosters to automatically shut down if they detect they might interfere with cell towers, so sometimes in really marginal signal areas they might not work as well as you'd hope. Also make sure whatever you buy is FCC certified - there are some sketchy imported ones on Amazon that aren't legal to use in the US. ... score: 0.50883

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey, I’ve looked into this quite a bit for camping and hiking trips! You’re right that most cell boosters, like the ones from weBoost or SureCall, need at least a faint signal to amplify—so that one bar of LTE is enough to work with. For portable options, check out the weBoost Drive Sleek or the SureCall Fusion2Go Max. They're both designed for vehicles, but many people use them with portable battery packs or car batteries when stationary in the woods. Just keep in mind, you’ll need to power the booster and set up the outside antenna somewhere with the best line of sight (like hoisting it up a tree), and they generally only boost signal for a phone that’s physically close to the internal cradle or antenna. They’re not totally “pocket portable” but are about as mobile as boosters get. If you’re hiking away from camp, they won’t work, but for boosting signal at base camp or inside a vehicle, they’re a solid choice. Hope that helps! ... score: 0.65338

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I’ve been in a similar situation where I only had a single bar of LTE deep in the woods, and I wanted to boost that signal without relying on satellite. From my experience, portable cell signal boosters that work off a weak existing signal can help, but there are some important things to consider. First, you need an external antenna to pick up the weak signal outside your shelter or vehicle since indoor signals tend to be worse. Then, the booster amplifies that signal and rebroadcasts it inside your setup. Brands like weBoost and SureCall have portable options, but they can be pricey and sometimes bulky. Also, check that the booster supports your carrier's frequency bands—some boosters are locked to specific carriers, while others are more universal. Keep in mind, if you truly only have a tiny flicker of LTE, these boosters can only amplify what’s there, so if your signal completely drops, the booster won’t create one out of thin air. Lastly, battery life and portability matter a lot for woods trips, so look for units designed for outdoor use with rechargeable batteries and rugged builds. Overall, these devices can significantly improve your connectivity in fringe areas, but don’t expect miracles if you’re way out in the middle of nowhere. Hope that helps! ... score: 0.49333

Seeing things like [this post](https://x.com/zerohedge/status/1883318929025884322?s=46&t=kHaY-toAbm_lcqzA_yNpEA) in regards to DeepSeek. Isn’t it just another LLM? I’ve seen other posts around how it could lead to the downfall of Nvidia and the Mag7? Is this just all bs?

Reddit author comment: Answer: DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, just dropped its R1 model, and it’s giving Silicon Valley a panic attack. Why? They trained it for just $5.6 million, chump change compared to the Billions companies like OpenAI and Google throw around, and are asking the US government for Billions more. The silicon valley AI companies have been saying that there's no way to train AI cheaper, and that what they need is more power.

DeepSeek pulled it off by optimizing hardware and letting the model basically teach itself. There are some companies that have heavily invested in using AI that are now really rethinking about which model they'll be using. DeepSeek's R1 is a fraction of the cost, but I've heard as much slower. Still this isn't shock waves around the tech industry, and honestly made the American AI companies look foolish. ... score: 0.00106

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: DeepSeek isn't just "another LLM" - it's potentially a game-changer because of how efficiently it was developed. The big story here is that this Chinese AI lab claims to have achieved GPT-4 level performance while spending only a fraction of what OpenAI, Google, and others have invested. We're talking millions vs billions in training costs. If true, this completely disrupts the narrative that you need massive capital expenditure and thousands of high-end GPUs to compete in AI. The market is freaking out because companies like Nvidia have been riding the AI gold rush, selling chips at premium prices under the assumption that AI development requires enormous computational resources. DeepSeek's approach suggests there might be more efficient ways to train these models, which could reduce demand for expensive hardware. It's not necessarily the "downfall" of Nvidia, but it definitely challenges their current pricing power and growth projections in the AI sector. ... score: 0.00012

Nvidia’s dominance isn’t just about LLMs—they have a massive ecosystem in GPUs, data centers, AI frameworks, and more. Plus, there are tons of competitors trying to develop similar or better models all the time. Unless DeepSeek introduces some fundamentally new architecture or massively outperforms current offerings, I’d take these claims with a grain of salt.

DeepSeek is indeed another LLM, but its architecture and capabilities are quite distinct from its predecessors. For instance, its ability to learn from a wider range of data sources and its more advanced reasoning capabilities make it a potentially game-changing technology. The post you linked from ZeroHedge highlights some of the potential risks associated with DeepSeek, such as its potential to disrupt the GPU market and the impact it could have on Nvidia's stock price. However, it's essential to consider the source of this information and the potential biases that may be at play. ZeroHedge is known for its sensationalized headlines and bearish outlook on the market, so it's crucial to take their claims with a grain of salt. Furthermore, the Mag7, which includes companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, are not just going to sit back and let DeepSeek disrupt their businesses without putting up a fight. They have the resources and expertise to adapt to changing market conditions and develop their own competing technologies.

The claims about it leading to the downfall of Nvidia and the Mag7 seem a bit overblown. Nvidia has a strong foothold in the GPU market, and while new players can certainly disrupt the ecosystem, it's not going to happen overnight. The Mag7, on the other hand, is a more niche player, so they might feel the heat more.

Post: Do you have carpet and lots of plants? How do you deal with cleaning/protection?
Hello! 

We are replacing flooring in this area. This is a second living room/den in the lowest level of our tri-level home. It gets COLD down here bc it’s a concrete slab high ceilings and windows and also bc it was an addition to the house and the HVAC wasn’t done right. So carpet is a plus bc it’s warmer and more comfortable. (Also not a high traffic area.) 

Anyway!! So I wanted to do hardwood to match upstairs and for easy cleaning but it’s sooooo expensive. Replacing carpet is a third of the price. We are also doing a full kitchen remodel so we have to pick and choose priorities of where the money goes. (The whole house needs updating!) 

Anyway!! So my biggest concern is the mess of the plants!!  They drop leaves, I spill dirt and water sometimes, but currently don’t care at alllll bc the carpet is decades old and already gross. 

(I also hate LVP which is the middle cost options bc I’m a nature loving person and it looks fake, especially bc upper two floors are beautiful natural hardwood and the transition would be more noticeable. We also have heavy workout equipment in the room adjacent that we were told would put too much pressure on the LVP floating floor system and make it buckle.) 

Sorry for the flooring/houseplants crossover but definitely wanted the opinion of my plant people!! 

Thank you!!

Post: Buttercup (The Princess Bride/Book v Movie)
I was looking over The Princess Bride. The first time I'd read it, I felt like the movie didn't stray too far from the book, but this time I couldn't help but notice how much of Buttercup's background and character arc are completely cut from the movie.

**Gone from the movie:** *her parents, her distain from being girly and making herself pretty to attract boys, her difficulty trying to live a normal life when people keep putting her on a pedestal, her realization that she needs to put Westley and her family before her own needs.* 

All of that's just from the first chapter!

I felt like movie Buttercup is portrayed as a selfish woman, and while she does suffer in the film, nothing she experiences really changes her personality. She stays selfish right up until the ending credits. 

Am I crazy? Did you get a different impression of Buttercup from the movie versus the book? Let me know!

Reddit author comment: Buttercup of the novel is also kind of a ditzy airhead, and the movie removes that entirely, to the character’s benefit.  

For the most part I like the movie version of that story much better.  But there are some interesting character elements that get left behind, or are only glancingly referenced.  For example, there’s an interesting theme running through the novel where characters all think one very specific thing about themselves, and are almost always *wrong*.  Humperdinck thinks he’s brave; really he’s a coward.  Vizzini believes he’s the smartest man alive; is wrong about everything.  Fezzik thinks himself stupid, and while he has a simple view of the world, he’s almost unerringly right about everything.  Inigo believes he’s useless at planning—so he sets out a step by step, intricate plan to rescue the man in black from the most dangerous place in the kingdom, so that the man in black can make the plan that will get him into the castle on his revenge quest. ... score: 0.03027

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're absolutely not crazy! This is one of the most glaring differences between the book and movie, and it's honestly my biggest gripe with the film adaptation (though I still love it). Book Buttercup has so much more depth and agency - she's actively struggling with her identity, her relationships, and her place in the world. The movie strips away all of that internal conflict and character development, leaving us with what essentially amounts to a beautiful damsel in distress. I think the filmmakers were so focused on the adventure and romance elements that they forgot Buttercup needed to be a fully realized character too. The book shows her grappling with expectations, trying to figure out how to be true to herself while also caring for others, and actually growing as a person. Movie Buttercup just... exists to be rescued and to look pretty while Westley does all the heavy lifting. It's such a shame because Robin Wright is a fantastic actress who could have absolutely nailed the more complex version of the character if given the material to work with. ... score: 0.10353

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally agree with you. The first time I saw the movie, I thought Buttercup was just a standard damsel-in-distress: she's pretty, she's there to be rescued, and she mostly just reacts to what happens around her. After reading the book, though, I was shocked at how much depth was missing from her character onscreen. In the book, you actually get to see her grow and change, dealing with her insecurities and the way people objectify her. She has a real arc about learning what matters and who she is, which is almost completely erased in the film. I think the movie wanted to keep things light and fast-paced, but in the process, they flattened Buttercup into a more passive character who never really gets a chance to shine or evolve. It's a shame, because her journey in the book adds a lot of nuance to the story. ... score: 0.90387

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally agree with you! The book dives so much deeper into Buttercup’s character and really humanizes her in ways the movie just glosses over. In the novel, you get this sense that she’s struggling against the expectations placed on her, and that internal conflict makes her a lot more relatable and complex. The movie, while iconic, kind of simplifies her down to the classic damsel in distress trope, which doesn’t do justice to her growth or the emotional nuances that Goldman wrote. It’s interesting how cutting those details changes our perception of her from a flawed but evolving person to just a static character.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who's read the book and seen the movie multiple times, I must say that your observation about Buttercup's character arc is spot on. The movie does leave out a significant amount of her background and development, which makes her come across as somewhat one-dimensional and selfish. In the book, her struggles to navigate her feelings and her place in the world are much more nuanced and relatable. For instance, her disdain for the societal expectations placed on her as a woman, particularly in terms of beauty and marriage, is a major theme in the book. This is evident in her initial reluctance to take care of her appearance and her frustration with being treated like a prize to be won. The movie, on the other hand, glosses over these complexities and reduces her character to a more simplistic, damsel-in-distress trope. I think it's interesting that you mention her realization that she needs to put Westley and her family before her own needs, because this is a crucial aspect of her growth as a character. In the book, she comes to understand that her love for Westley is not just a romantic feeling, but also a deep-seated commitment to prioritizing his well-being and happiness above her own desires. This is something that's largely absent from the movie, where her love for Westley is portrayed more as a passionate, all-consuming emotion rather than a thoughtful, selfless choice. ... score: 0.95019

The movie simplifies her character to the point where she comes off as more one-dimensional and, as you said, selfish. It's a shame because the book really delves into her growth and the internal conflicts she faces, especially when it comes to her relationship with Westley and her family.

Post: [TENANT] Property Inspections
I've been renting a close to 4,000 square foot house in an upscale neighborhood in Southern Arizona for almost 4 years.  The property has been managed by the same property management company for the whole time.  In the annual lease, there is a clause that the home is to be inspected every 90 days.  They send a letter every 90 days giving me about 5 days notice as to when the inspector will be there.


I received a letter from them today saying that the inspector will be there this coming Monday.  I called them and asked to reschedule until after the holidays as this is a really hectic time for our family.  We have a couple of parties planned, one for clients -- one for friends, the house is in minor chaos mode with presents being wrapped, etc., etc., you get the picture.  If the inspection was just a quick glance around it would be one thing, but this guy spends almost an hour there, checking HVAC filters, poking his head in closets, going in/out of every room in the house, checking the bathrooms, looking in the oven -- it drives me nuts.


They were completely uncooperative about rescheduling saying they had a lot of properties to inspect and didn't schedule any the week between Christmas and New Year's and we couldn't change the date.  I also asked them if they could change the frequency of the inspections to semi-annually rather than quarterly and they said they couldn't unless the landlord initiated the request, they wouldn't go to him to ask.


I can understand if I were a bad tenant, was late paying the rent, made a lot of requests for repairs, damaged the place, etc.  I haven't had one single issue since moving in.  I only repair I have had them fix was when a control unit went out on the double oven.  I have the carpets cleaned twice a year at my expense.


I have the telephone number and address of the actual owner of the property.  Do you 1) think I'm being reasonable to ask for a reduction in the number of inspections?, and 2) if the management company isn't interested in contacting the landlord of my behalf, do you think it is reasonable to contact the landlord directly?

Reddit author comment: Don't worry about contacting the owner. I've had some bad experiences with property management companies and have always been able to resolve issues with the owner directly. I would send the owner a letter stating how you always cooperate and change your schedule for these frequent inspections but the one time you requested it during this hectic time the property management company refused. Because of this, you are requesting the inspections be less frequent so this problem will be avoided in the future. I think it would help if you were able to find out how often HVAC filters and whatever else the guy looks at need inspected/replaced. I've never heard of 90 day inspections, it seems like maybe the management company is getting something out of it. In any case, I've never had an issue that wasn't resolved by a polite letter to the owner. If it doesn't get changed then definitely use your next renewal as leverage when it comes time. ... score: 0.27499

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're absolutely being reasonable here! Quarterly inspections for a 4-year tenant with a spotless record is honestly excessive, especially for such thorough hour-long inspections. Most landlords do annual inspections at most, and some only inspect when there's a specific concern or between tenants. The fact that you've had zero issues, pay on time, and even go above and beyond with carpet cleaning at your own expense shows you're an ideal tenant. The property management company is being unnecessarily rigid - good property managers work with reliable tenants, not against them. I'd definitely contact the landlord directly. You're not going behind anyone's back since the management company explicitly said they won't advocate for you. Frame it positively when you call - mention how much you love the property, your track record as a tenant, and that you'd like to discuss potentially reducing inspection frequency to semi-annual given your history. Most reasonable landlords would be happy to accommodate a proven tenant, especially one who's been there 4 years.

You have every right to advocate for yourself, and I don’t see anything wrong with politely reaching out to the landlord.

Quarterly inspections might make sense for problem tenants, but for someone like you, semi-annual or even annual inspections should suffice. As for contacting the landlord directly, I think it’s fair. If the management company isn’t advocating for you or willing to negotiate, reaching out to the property owner might get things moving.

The fact that the management company is unwilling to work with you to reschedule the inspection or even consider changing the frequency of the inspections is quite inflexible.

However, given the circumstances, I believe it's reasonable to reach out to the landlord, especially since you've already established a good relationship with the property.

Post: Castration vs implant - what's your preference?
I'm curious as to people's personal preferences is all. I'm doing my own research into the health risks and advantages. I know the research suggesting that castrated males tend more towards adrenal disease but I also know that research is primarily done in Marshalls ferrets.

All my boys have been rescues and have been castrated before coming to me. There's a boy needing a home in another rescue who is entire and they'd rehome him entire. He's alone and has zero interest and it breaks my heart when I've got the ability to take him. 

Having never been in the position to make the decision for myself I'm curious to know what people's preferences are. Does the implant have the same effect on the coat type and scent? 

I've got no issue with the smell personally. I just don't know how my guys would respond to his scent if they've not been used to it.

Reddit author comment: I'd say implant is 90% smell reduction and castration 95%. It mellows them down a lot. Coat is much less oily. It takes 10 weeks for full effects and all sperms to be "nutralised" but same for castrate. They calm down a lot after about 2 weeks. 

You do get an increase in smell when they are coming back into season which is good news if run a mixed group and any jills implanted. And that is the big downside for me. I usually get 3-4 years between implants for neutering but currently have a 8 year old hob with spleen issue and his balls are reappearing. He is too weak to reimplant and though he has no interest in sex, the other hobs can be a bit nasty to entire hobs. Last time it happened was with a 10 year old hob who had no interest in sex but I had to split him out with couple of older ladies for cuddles and tea.

I tend to implant if health, age or aggression/fear means an operation is off the cards. My two implanted hobs at moment - the polecat was next to impossible to handle from fear and the other put me in A&E so not leaving him to bite the vet. He is reformed and will get castrated when he comes back in. ... score: 0.33375

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've had experience with both options and honestly, I lean towards the implant (Suprelorin) these days. The research you mentioned about adrenal disease is definitely worth considering - while it's primarily from Marshall's ferrets, the correlation is pretty significant. My first two boys were castrated traditionally and both developed adrenal issues around 4-5 years old, which was heartbreaking and expensive to manage. When I got my current ferret, I went with the implant route. The scent difference is noticeable but not overwhelming - he definitely has that musky ferret smell that intact males have, but it's not unbearable. My other ferrets took about a week to fully adjust to his scent, and there was some initial posturing, but nothing aggressive. The implant does reduce the oily coat somewhat, though not as dramatically as surgical castration. The peace of mind regarding adrenal disease risk makes it worth it for me, plus you have the option to let it wear off if needed. ... score: 0.17289

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I’ve had both castrated and entire males with des implants in my ferret group, so hopefully my experience helps! In terms of health, the research does suggest that castration (especially early, like Marshall’s does) can up the risk for adrenal issues later in life. The des implant works by suppressing the hormones that trigger adrenal disease, so in theory, it’s a safer route if you want to avoid surgery and potential complications. As for coat and scent—intact males generally have coarser, oilier coats and a much stronger, musky odor, especially during breeding season. The implant does help reduce both over time, but it may not completely eliminate the smell or return the coat to what you’d see in a neutered male. Socially, your neutered boys might be a bit wary at first because of the unfamiliar scent, but in my experience, they get used to it after a proper introduction and time to adjust. If you’re open to the implant, I’d definitely suggest discussing it with your vet and seeing how your group does with gradual intros! ... score: 0.53367

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I've had experience with both castration and implants in ferrets, and honestly, each has its pros and cons. Castration definitely reduces the risk of some hormonal behaviors like spraying and aggression, and it tends to mellow them out quite a bit. The implant, on the other hand, can maintain some of those natural hormone levels, which might be better for their overall health long-term, especially concerning adrenal disease risks. Regarding coat and scent, the implant usually doesn’t cause as much of a change compared to castration, so the ferret might keep more of their original smell. If your current boys are used to no scent from castrated ferrets, I’d guess they might be confused or put off by the implant ferret’s scent initially, but they could adjust over time. It’s a tough call, but if adrenal health is a priority, the implant might be worth considering. ... score: 0.4288

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a veterinarian with a specialty in ferret care, I must say that the debate between castration and implanting is a complex one, and there's no straightforward answer. While castration has been the traditional method of controlling ferret populations and reducing certain health risks, implants have become increasingly popular in recent years due to their potential to mitigate some of the negative side effects associated with castration, such as adrenal disease. However, it's essential to consider the individual ferret's needs, health status, and lifestyle when making this decision. For example, if the ferret is prone to certain health issues or has a history of aggression, castration might be the better option. On the other hand, if the ferret is relatively healthy and has a calm temperament, an implant could be a viable alternative. Ultimately, it's crucial to consult with a veterinarian to determine the best course of action for each ferret. In terms of coat type and scent, implants can help reduce the strength of the ferret's musky smell, but the effect may vary depending on the individual ferret and the type of implant used. As for the interaction between the new ferret and your existing rescues, it's always a good idea to introduce them slowly and under controlled circumstances to minimize any potential conflicts. ... score: 0.18606

With neutering, you eliminate the risk of testicular cancer and reduce the risk of prostate issues. However, as you mentioned, there's a potential link to adrenal disease. The implant, on the other hand, is reversible and doesn't require surgery, but it needs to be replaced every few months. As for the scent, the implant does reduce it, but it might not eliminate it completely. It's also worth noting that ferrets are social animals, and they might adapt to the new scent.

The implant definitely helps with the scent, making it more manageable, but it's not completely gone. I think it's a good middle ground between castration and leaving them entire. The coat type seems to stay pretty much the same, but I've noticed a slight difference in their behavior—less aggressive, more relaxed. My boys get along really well, and I think the implant helps with that. Just my two cents, but I'd definitely recommend it if you're considering taking in the entire male. It's a safer option health-wise and seems to have fewer long-term risks compared to castration. Plus, it's reversible if you ever need to adjust the dosage.

Post: How do you know if you have PTSD?
How do you know if you have PTSD? I know what I went through was traumatic. It has been 6 months now since I have been away from it. I had severe anxiety and depression from long before and it’s mostly treatment resistant. I’m having a hard time figuring out if this is just my normal severe anxiety or if it could be mixed with PTSD now. I have a therapist and psychiatrist I am working with. I have made a lot of progress in some ways. I just don’t know if this is the start of PTSD or not and it scared me

Reddit author comment: you get a diagnosis from your therapist or other professional. for me, i was inpatient and suffering greatly so there was really no question for them, and i did not contradict them.

ptsd is one of those things that needs caution in self-diagnosis, as there are other disorders that have severe anxiety (gad), or have definite triggers leading to strange behavior (ocd), or psychotic behavior (a whole suite of them), etc.

being past the 6 month mark, if you're experiencing the symptoms, it will be ptsd instead of pts.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I really understand your confusion and fear about this - it's actually pretty common to wonder whether what you're experiencing is PTSD, especially when you already have existing anxiety and depression. The overlap between these conditions can make it really difficult to tease apart what's what. From what I've learned through my own therapy journey, PTSD typically involves specific symptoms that go beyond general anxiety: intrusive thoughts or flashbacks about the traumatic event, nightmares, avoiding things that remind you of the trauma, feeling emotionally numb or disconnected, being hypervigilant or easily startled, and having negative thoughts about yourself or the world that started after the trauma. The fact that you're already working with both a therapist and psychiatrist is huge - they're really the best people to help you figure this out.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: PTSD can be tricky to identify, especially when you already have anxiety and depression, because the symptoms can overlap. Some of the classic signs of PTSD include re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive thoughts, nightmares, or flashbacks, avoiding things that remind you of the event, being hyper-alert or easily startled, and feeling emotionally numb or disconnected from others. Sometimes it also shows up as irritability, trouble sleeping, or difficulty concentrating. Since you already work with a therapist and psychiatrist, it might help to bring up these specific symptoms and see if they resonate with your experience. Try keeping a journal of symptoms and triggers to discuss in therapy. Remember, it's okay to be scared, but you're not alone and you're already doing important work by seeking help and self-reflecting. ... score: 0.35125

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: It’s completely understandable to feel uncertain about whether what you’re experiencing is PTSD, especially when you already have pre-existing anxiety and depression. PTSD symptoms can sometimes overlap with other mental health issues, which makes it tricky to differentiate on your own. Common signs of PTSD include flashbacks, nightmares, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, heightened startle response, and feeling emotionally numb or detached. Since you’re already working with a therapist and psychiatrist, it’s great you have professional support—definitely keep them updated about your symptoms and concerns. They can help clarify whether what you’re feeling is part of PTSD or a different manifestation of anxiety. Remember, healing is a process, and having mixed symptoms is not unusual. Take it one step at a time and be gentle with yourself. ... score: 0.53065

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I completely understand your concern, and it's great that you're seeking professional help from a therapist and psychiatrist. To determine if you have PTSD, it's essential to pay attention to specific symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety, and uncontrollable thoughts about the traumatic event. Since you've experienced severe anxiety and depression before, it might be challenging to distinguish between the two conditions. However, if you notice that your symptoms have worsened or changed since the traumatic event, it could be a sign of PTSD. Your therapist and psychiatrist can help you identify the root cause of your symptoms and develop a treatment plan tailored to your needs. Remember that PTSD can manifest in different ways, and only a professional diagnosis can confirm whether you have the condition. Keep working with your healthcare team, and don't hesitate to ask questions or express your concerns. ... score: 0.43128

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I can totally relate to how you're feeling. It's really tough to distinguish between what's part of your pre-existing anxiety and what might be new PTSD symptoms. One thing that helped me was paying attention to specific triggers. For example, do certain sounds, smells, or situations bring back intense memories or feelings related to the trauma? If so, that could be a sign of PTSD. It's also really important to keep track of any new or worsening symptoms, like flashbacks, nightmares, or a feeling of being constantly on edge. Your therapist and psychiatrist are great resources—don't hesitate to bring up these concerns with them. They can help you navigate this and figure out the best course of action. It's okay to be scared, but you're taking the right steps by seeking help and being proactive about your mental health. You're not alone in this. 🌟💪 ... score: 0.4839

Post: Whatcha Watching Wednesday
*What are you watching? How is it? Got a recommendation or need something new to watch?*

&nbsp;

It's the middle of the summer and the best thing on tv right now is **______________**? Again, if you're a /r/TopGear fan, you're loving this time of year! So what are you watching? Is it on Netflix or Hulu or is it something rerunning on SpeedVision?  Late to the game and wondering why everyone loves /r/orangeisthenewblack?  

&nbsp;

**Please** use spoiler tags if you're revealing a huge part of *any* show's plot, no one wants a recommendation where they find out that the end of Luther was [](/s "something I need to catch up on, hold your horses")!


&nbsp;

&nbsp;

And yes, there will be trivia. Possibly this evening, more info to follow.

Reddit author comment: Just finished my marathon of HBO's Oz.

Sure, it got a little weird in the middle there with the medicine that ages you 40 years and the whole Luke Perry saga, but damn, it is an all around great show. The beginning of an era for television.

Every character was really really flawed. Most were quite evil, but you gave a damn about nearly all of them at least once during the six seasons. Even Schillinger and Robson (Aryans/Nazis).

And you never felt any of your favourite characters were safe from death. It came for damn near everyone by the end of it.

Next on my marathon list is 'The Wire'. ... score: 0.18742

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been absolutely devouring **The Bear** on FX/Hulu and holy shit, what a ride. Just finished season 2 and I'm emotionally exhausted in the best possible way. For those who haven't watched it yet, it follows Carmen "Carmy" Berzatto, a world-class chef who returns to Chicago to run his deceased brother's Italian beef sandwich shop. The show perfectly captures the chaos and intensity of working in a kitchen - the constant yelling, the pressure, the camaraderie that forms under stress. Jeremy Allen White's performance is phenomenal; you can feel Carmy's anxiety and trauma radiating through the screen. What makes this show special is how it balances comedy with genuine emotional depth. One minute you're laughing at the ridiculous situations these characters find themselves in, and the next you're tearing up as they deal with grief, addiction, and family trauma. The supporting cast is incredible too - each character feels real and lived-in. If you're looking for something that will make you laugh, cry, and stress-eat simultaneously, this is it. Fair warning though: don't watch it when you're hungry because those sandwich shots will destroy you. ... score: 0.84092

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I just finished binge-watching "The Bear" on Hulu, and wow, I cannot recommend it enough! It’s about a young chef who comes back to run his family’s sandwich shop in Chicago, and the show does such an awesome job capturing the stress and chaos of kitchen life. The acting is top-notch—Jeremy Allen White absolutely kills it in the lead role—and the writing is sharp and funny. It's only a couple of seasons so far, so not a huge commitment, but every episode feels intense and real. If you liked shows like "Kitchen Confidential" or even the more dramatic parts of "Chef’s Table," this is right up your alley. Plus, the character development is fantastic; you really get to care about the whole crew. Highly recommend giving it a shot if you’re looking for something new! ... score: 0.00135

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Right now, I’m completely hooked on **Severance** on Apple TV+. The blend of psychological thriller and corporate satire is just next-level, and the cinematography is stunning. It’s one of those shows that makes you question reality and your own work-life balance simultaneously. If you enjoy mind-bending plots with a slow build, this is definitely worth your time. On the lighter side, I recently rewatched **Brooklyn Nine-Nine** on Hulu, and it’s such a feel-good comedy that never gets old. For anyone who needs something new but also comforting, that’s my go-to recommendation! Also, yes to the Top Gear love—nothing beats those epic road trip episodes in the summer. ... score: 0.08845

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm really enjoying this time of year for TV, the new season of Top Gear has just started and it's already shaping up to be one of the best yet, the chemistry between the hosts is undeniable and the challenges they're undertaking are both hilarious and impressive, I've also been keeping up with the latest season of Stranger Things, which is just as captivating as the previous ones, the nostalgic value is still there and the storyline is getting more and more intricate, I'm not sure what I'll watch next but I'm considering checking out The Umbrella Academy, has anyone seen it and what are your thoughts, I've heard mixed reviews but I'm curious to see how it adapts the comic book series, also I'm excited about the trivia tonight, I hope it's not too difficult and we can all have a fun time discussing our favorite shows and competing against each other. ... score: 0.45556

The storyline is so captivating and the characters are well-developed, especially the kids. The show does a great job of blending science fiction, horror, and a nostalgic 80s vibe.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I just finished watching "Stranger Things" on Netflix, and I am completely hooked! I can't get over the '80s vibe, the incredible soundtrack, and the suspenseful plot. It's a perfect mix of nostalgia and modern storytelling. I literally binged the entire season in two days. If you haven't started it yet, you're missing out on a real gem. The characters are so well-developed, and the mysteries keep you on the edge of your seat. I especially love Eleven and her mysterious powers. It's a must-watch for anyone who loves sci-fi, horror, and a good dose of nostalgia. Can't wait to see what happens in the next season! ... score: 0.67055
