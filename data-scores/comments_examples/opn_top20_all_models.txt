Post: Can you recommend lonely films with subtle romance?
Hit me with romance films that feel isolated, melancholic, and simmer quietly. Think Blade Runner 2049’s Joe and Joi, soft connections and zero rushed passion. 

**Any genre works**; as long as it has that bittersweet atmospheric ache. Bonus if the romance lingers in glances/gestures instead of grand speeches.

Reddit author comment: Maybe one of the most beautifully poetic and elegantly made explorations of love, sorrow, and beauty In the Mood for Love.

Late Spring if you want a film that shows how societal expectations of love can cause people sorrow

Past Lives for something more recent to explore the complexity of maneuvering through love in a modern age where our desires are often at odds with time and the stringent social norms of marriage

Au Hasard Balthazar if you want a more platonic love that is all the more heartbreaking for it's innocence. It is about the parallel lives of a young lady and her pet donkey

Stella Dallas for a classic melodrama that deals with familial and romantic love leading to loneliness and will make anyone with emotions ugly cry several times. ... score: 0.60035

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, you're describing some of my absolute favorite types of films! First thing that comes to mind is **Her** - the entire movie is basically Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with an AI while wandering through a beautifully lonely Los Angeles. The romance builds through conversations and small moments, never feeling rushed or overly dramatic. Another perfect fit is **Lost in Translation** - Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have this incredible quiet connection in Tokyo, all communicated through glances and shared isolation. The ending whisper scene still gives me chills. For something more sci-fi, try **Moon** - while not traditionally romantic, Sam Rockwell's relationship with his AI companion GERTY has this tender, melancholic quality you're looking for. **The Shape of Water** might work too, though it's more fantastical - the romance between Sally Hawkins and the amphibian creature is told almost entirely through gestures and looks, with this beautiful underwater dreamlike quality. And if you want something really atmospheric, **Only Lovers Left Alive** follows two vampire lovers across centuries, all moody nighttime scenes and languid conversations about art and mortality. ... score: 0.52252

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get what you’re after! One of my all-time favorite films that fits your description is “In the Mood for Love” by Wong Kar-wai. It's set in 1960s Hong Kong and is basically the blueprint for subtle, melancholic romance. The tension between the two protagonists is built on longing, shared glances, and gestures rather than any overt passion or declarations. The cinematography and soundtrack just ooze loneliness and unspoken desire. Another great pick would be “Lost in Translation” – it’s more modern, but the connection between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray is quietly devastating and beautifully understated. Both films really capture that ache of wanting, but not quite having, and the atmosphere is thick with solitude. Would highly recommend if you’re in the mood for something that lingers long after the credits roll. ... score: 0.45417

It’s drenched in melancholy and longing, with the two leads sharing stolen moments and subtle gestures that speak volumes without ever crossing certain lines. The atmosphere is thick with loneliness and unspoken desire, and the romantic tension is almost tangible in every scene.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm absolutely obsessed with the concept of subtle romance in films, and I think it's because it resonates so deeply with my own experiences of longing and connection. For me, the film that epitomizes this theme is "Lost in Translation" - the way Bob and Charlotte form a bond over their shared feelings of loneliness and disconnection in a bustling city is just so poignant. The romance is never overt, but it's always there, simmering beneath the surface in the way they look at each other, the way they touch. It's a film that understands that sometimes the most powerful connections are the ones that are left unspoken. I also appreciate how the film explores the idea of human connection in a hyper-modern world, where people are increasingly isolated despite being surrounded by others. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the neon-lit landscapes of Tokyo and the quiet, introspective moments between the characters. If you're looking for other films that capture this same atmosphere, I'd also recommend "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "Before Sunrise" - both of which feature complex, nuanced relationships that are full of subtle moments of tenderness and intimacy. ... score: 0.50743

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I'd recommend "The Lobster" (2015) by Yorgos Lanthimos. It’s a dystopian romance where characters are sent to The Hotel to find a romantic partner or be turned into an animal of their choice. The atmosphere is stark and isolating, with a romance that builds through subtle gestures and glances rather than grand declarations. The film's unique setting and dark humor add to its melancholic tone, making it a perfect fit for your criteria. The relationship between Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz is particularly poignant, with a quiet, unspoken connection that feels both tender and fragile. It’s a film that lingers in your mind long after it’s over, much like the bittersweet ache you're looking for. ... score: 0.51136

Post: [DISCUSSION] Bipolar in famous poetry
So this is a topic I've been curious about for quite a while, and surprisingly there isn't that much on Google about it.

A symptom of bipolar disorder is having "delusions of grandeur", which Psych Central describes as "fixed, false belief that one possesses superior qualities such as genius, fame, omnipotence, or wealth". I was recently diagnosed  and came to the realization that my delusions are centered around art, specifically poetry.

Not out of self indulgence, I was curious about how bipolar played a role in the lives and works of famous poets who were diagnosed. As in, did their "delusions" (outdated word) revolve around the success of their poetry? Were they aware of it and how did they address their illness in their works? In specific cases, was there a noticeable shift in their writings after going on medication? Also, were there any poets who were bipolar or of a similar diagnosis, but was never prevalent in their poetry? 

Because as far as I am aware, it is most prevalent in confessional poetry. Anne Sexton is a prime example, with their most famous works being about depression and suicide. I always recall one of the last poems she wrote and published posthumously, where she discusses "escaping Dr. Death", but then committing suicide months later. There isn't much talk about the "delusions" she experienced, or the drive she had to live. Robert Lowell is another notable example, with him being one of the earliest confessional poets and it being a discussion point, but was wondering who else and if they had any idealization of writing groundbreaking poetry.

Thank you!

Reddit author comment: You can read Touched with fire by Dr Kay Redfield Jamison about bipolar and creativity she goes through many artists and poets.There is also a film Touched with fire about two bipolar poets.Mania was considered divine in Ancient Greece,and there is a whole book on Amazon on divine mania in Ancient Greece.In ancient times it was considered possession by the gods,so I’m not surprised we have delusions of grandeur,even in Korean shamanism it’s considered possession by the gods called your momju shin.Madness and divine poetry were very closely linked in the ancient world.

Psychiatry on the other hand operates purely from an atheist worldview that denies all spiritual experience.

Also Lord Byron had a lot of grandeur, he’s featured in Jamison’s book he wrote ’We of the craft are all crazy. Some are affected by gaiety, others by melancholy , but all are more or less touched.'

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is such a fascinating topic and I'm glad you brought it up! As someone who's also dealt with bipolar disorder, I've found myself drawn to poets like Sylvia Plath and Theodore Roethke for similar reasons. What's interesting about your question regarding delusions of grandeur is that sometimes those "delusions" weren't entirely unfounded - many of these poets did achieve lasting fame and recognition, which creates this weird paradox. Take Robert Lowell, for instance. His manic episodes often coincided with periods of intense creativity and grandiose beliefs about his literary importance, but he genuinely was one of the most significant American poets of the 20th century. I think there's also something to be said about how the intensity of bipolar experiences - both manic and depressive - provides rich material for poetry. The heightened emotions, the extreme shifts in perception, the way reality can feel malleable during episodes - all of that translates into powerful verse. Regarding medication effects, I know Lowell struggled with this exact issue, often going off his meds because he feared they would dull his creative edge. It's a common dilemma for artists with bipolar disorder. ... score: 0.50532

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is such a fascinating topic! I think you’re absolutely right that bipolar disorder, particularly the grandiosity aspect, doesn’t get as much attention in discussions of poetry as depression and suicidality do. Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell are definitely the most cited, but there are other poets where hints appear. For example, Sylvia Plath’s work often gets analyzed through the lens of depression, but some scholars have suggested her periods of intense productivity and the almost mythic self-portrayal in poems like “Lady Lazarus” could reflect manic or hypomanic states. Same with Delmore Schwartz and John Berryman, although again it’s rarely framed as “delusions of grandeur” but more as existential drama or artistic ambition. The problem is that a lot of the language around these experiences is pathologizing, so poets themselves might not have written openly about “delusions,” but rather couched their feelings in metaphors of flight, power, or visionary insight. It would be really interesting to map out shifts pre- and post-medication, though I suspect a lot of poets (especially from earlier generations) never got effective treatment. Would love to hear if anyone has more contemporary examples! ... score: 0.49699

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This is such an insightful topic! Bipolar disorder has a complex relationship with creativity, and poetry seems to be one of the most intimate expressions of that. You're right that confessional poets like Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell are often cited because their work directly grapples with mental illness, but the connection between bipolar symptoms—especially those grandiose or euphoric states—and poetic ambition or style is fascinating and less discussed. For example, Sylvia Plath, although not officially diagnosed with bipolar, exhibited mood swings that influenced her intense, vivid imagery. Her bursts of creative energy often coincided with manic-like episodes. As for delusions of grandeur, I think many poets have a natural tendency toward idealizing their art, but in bipolar cases, this could be amplified, leading to both incredible productivity and destructive behaviors. It’s also interesting how medication can sometimes blunt that creative drive, which some poets have lamented, adding another layer of complexity to their relationship with their illness. I'd love to see more research or personal accounts on how poets feel their diagnosis has shaped not only their themes but their actual writing process. ... score: 0.58681

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm intrigued by your question about the relationship between bipolar disorder and the work of famous poets, particularly in regards to the theme of "delusions of grandeur" and how it manifests in their writing. The concept of delusions of grandeur is indeed complex and multifaceted, and it's interesting to consider how it might influence an artist's perception of their own work and abilities. In the case of confessional poets like Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell, it's possible that their experiences with bipolar disorder informed their writing in profound ways, perhaps even driving their creative output and shaping the themes and tone of their poetry. I'd love to explore this topic further and examine how other poets, such as Sylvia Plath or Ted Hughes, may have navigated the intersection of mental health and artistic expression in their own work. By examining the ways in which bipolar disorder influenced the lives and writing of these poets, we may gain a deeper understanding of the complex and often fraught relationship between creativity and mental health. ... score: 0.59161

Her work is deeply confessional and often touches on themes of depression and suicide, much like Anne Sexton.

Her journals and letters show a deep belief in her own genius and the potential for her work to be revolutionary. It's interesting to note how her writing evolved over time, especially as her mental health fluctuated. After she started medication, there was a noticeable shift in her tone and style, but her drive to write and create remained constant. I think Plath's case highlights the complex relationship between bipolar disorder and artistic expression, where the illness both fuels and challenges the creative process. It's a delicate balance, and her work continues to resonate with many who struggle with similar issues. What do you think about Plath's journey and how it compares to other poets you mentioned?

Post: Seriously, How should I study MICROTAXONOMY?
I’m so lost and confuse. Our professor doesn’t even teach and wants us to just study by ourselves. Please help.

Reddit author comment: You can start with an introduction to the basic concepts, I have searched for an exact index of a university introduction to the subject, perhaps it can help you. (Obviously, before moving on to microtaxidermy you must first understand taxidermy) 
1. Diversity sciences: includes macro and micro taxonomy
 2. Historical development of taxonomic ideas 
3. Strategies and tools for carrying out a taxonomic study 
4. Species delimitation 
5. Principles and methodology of phylogenetic reconstruction 
6. Mechanism of organic evolution  
7. Biological nomenclature
 8. Problems and perspectives of current taxidermy
 I personally think that it is much better if you have a biological species in mind to start the study and focus on it, so you could use it as an example to test your knowledge. ^_^

When professors just throw you into the deep end like that, it's incredibly frustrating. Here's what saved me: Start with a solid taxonomy textbook like Simpson's "Principles of Animal Taxonomy" or if you're doing plants, go with Stuessy's "Plant Taxonomy." Don't try to memorize everything at once - focus on understanding the hierarchical classification system first. Make flashcards for key terms and characteristics of major groups. Practice, practice, practice with identification keys until using them becomes second nature. Join study groups if possible, because having classmates to bounce ideas off of is invaluable. Also, spend time in the lab examining actual specimens - you can't learn this stuff just from books. The morphological details you need to recognize only become clear when you're looking at real organisms under a microscope. YouTube has some surprisingly good taxonomy tutorials too.

This year's meeting focuses on the ways humans manage apocalyptic risks, especially through cooperation, storytelling, entertainment and play, and I can't help but imagine incorporating these ideas into our theories about the future. The goal of ZAMM, as stated on the website, is to reduce the global burden of zombification and contribute to apocalypse prevention and preparedness through interdisciplinary engagement.  
  
While we might not all show up at this conference (though it would fascinating if we had a reddit takeover at this event, with wild theories flying around) I'm curious-- If you had a chance to present radical, out-of-the-box research designs, speculative theories, or experimental frameworks that defy constraints, what would you be interested in talk about? It could be a study too ambitious to fund, a concept so daring it might just work, a theory on the cutting edge of science fiction...what would you talk about?

\*\*Not sure if I'm allowed to post links to more info on this conference, but I added the link to their main website. Remove if not allowed!

  


Reddit author comment: We should research into bio engineering trees that grow into multistory structures that can be turned into homes. Or maybe giant gourds.

It will gather moisture from the air to provide drinking water. The inside of a new room will be full of strong fibers that can be turned into textiles. The sap is a painkiller, antibiotic and fever reducer. It will grow sticky flowers that can be molded like fiberglass that hardens into ceramics when left in the sun. The thorns it grows can be sharpened and shaped and turned into blades or kitchen utensils. 

We will call them Houseplants. ... score: 0.55885

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This sounds absolutely fascinating! I've always been obsessed with the idea of conducting a massive longitudinal study on collective human behavior during resource scarcity - something that would obviously be completely unethical to actually implement, but perfect for a zombie apocalypse framework. My wild theory is that humans actually have an untapped "hive mind" capability that only emerges during extreme crisis situations, similar to how certain ant colonies can make complex decisions without centralized leadership. I'd want to design an experiment that tests whether isolated groups of survivors would independently develop similar survival strategies, communication methods, and social hierarchies when faced with identical zombie threats. The study would involve creating controlled "apocalypse scenarios" with different variables - urban vs rural settings, different group sizes, varying resource availability - and then tracking how quickly groups develop cooperative behaviors, leadership structures, and innovative solutions. I think we'd discover that humans have dormant collective intelligence mechanisms that our modern society has actually suppressed. The implications for everything from disaster preparedness to organizational psychology would be mind-blowing. Plus, framing it through zombies makes it way more engaging than dry academic papers about crisis management! ... score: 0.5636

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is such a cool concept! If I could present an unhinged hypothesis at ZAMM, I'd love to explore the idea of "memetic inoculation"—basically, can we vaccinate society against dangerous ideas (like those that lead to mass hysteria or apocalyptic cults) by deliberately exposing people to weakened, fictional versions of these memes, much like how vaccines work for viruses? Using storytelling, VR simulations, and collaborative world-building games, we could test whether exposure to fictional apocalypses (zombies or otherwise) helps people build cognitive resilience, critical thinking, and collective coping mechanisms for real-world crises. The experiment would involve tracking participants over time, seeing if their reactions to disinformation campaigns, panic-inducing news, or conspiracy theories are more measured after a "memetic vaccine." It would blend psychology, media studies, immunology (in a metaphorical sense), and even a bit of improv theater. I think this kind of radical, playful approach could reveal a lot about how narratives shape our survival instincts and societal cohesion. ... score: 0.59287

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This conference sounds like an absolute dream for anyone who loves pushing the boundaries of conventional thought! If I had the chance to present, I'd propose an experiment that blends neuroscience with immersive virtual reality to simulate a full-scale zombie outbreak scenario. Imagine mapping real-time brain activity and group dynamics as participants navigate moral dilemmas, survival decisions, and social cooperation under extreme stress. The goal would be to uncover how empathy and trust evolve—or collapse—when society is on the brink of apocalypse. This could have incredible implications for understanding human behavior in crisis and improving disaster response strategies.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a physicist, I've always been fascinated by the concept of time and its relationship to the human experience, and I think it would be incredible to discuss the idea of time dilation in the context of a zombie apocalypse, where the laws of physics are pushed to the extreme and the fabric of time and space is altered, allowing for some incredible possibilities for scientific discovery and exploration, and I believe that this concept could be applied to the development of new technologies and innovations that could potentially help us better prepare for and respond to catastrophic events, such as the zombie apocalypse, and I think that the Zombie Apocalypse Medicine Meeting would be the perfect platform to explore this idea and its potential applications, and I would love to present a paper on this topic and hear from other experts in the field about their thoughts and perspectives on this concept and its potential implications for our understanding of the universe and our place within it. ... score: 0.6168

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and human consciousness. If I had a chance to present at ZAMM, I would propose an experiment where we explore the creation of a symbiotic relationship between AI and the human brain. Imagine a future where AI can not only augment our cognitive abilities but also help us navigate and mitigate the effects of a zombie apocalypse. For instance, an AI system could predict zombie movements, optimize resource allocation, and even help in the development of a cure. The experiment would involve creating a small, wearable device that can interface with the brain, allowing for real-time data exchange and decision-making support. The ethical implications would be vast, but the potential benefits in terms of human resilience and adaptability could be monumental. Plus, it would be a fascinating way to explore how we can use technology to enhance our survival in extreme scenarios, while also pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human in a post-apocalyptic world. I think this kind of research could not only be a game-changer for ZAMM but also spark new discussions in the broader scientific community about the future of AI and human collaboration.

Post: A fudgy brownie that isn't keto but uses sweetener instead of sugar recipe?
I am trying to look for a fudgy brownie recipe that isn't keto(that isn't high on fat), nor uses a ton of sugar(for example, +30g of sugar per square). Preferably sugar-free sweetener.

I am looking for a balanced one where it uses oat flour(for instances) and somewhat of a stevia/erythritol combo?

Reddit author comment: Banana Brownies
 
4 oz semisweet baking chocolate
4 oz bittersweet baking chocolate
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup mashed ripe banana (approx. 4 bananas; if not enough can substitute applesauce to fill 1 cup) 
2 Tbsp glycerine
2 Tbsp nature’s Hollow syrup
2 eggs
1/4 cup sola
1 cup white whole wheat  or whole wheat pastry flour
1 tsp almond or vanilla extract
 
Melt the semisweet and bittersweet chocolate (not the chips)
 
Mix banana mash, eggs, sola, glycerine, Nature’s Hollow syrup, and flavor extract in mixing bowl
 
Add melted chocolate and flour.  Then mix in the chocolate chips
 
Place in lightly oiled 9" square pan.  Bake at 350 (300 convection) 25-35 minutes.  Knife in center should be a bit gooey.  Or 1 dozen cupcakes, start checking after 14 minutes.

My recipe. There is still some sugar in the chocolate, but about 1 cup of sugar is eliminated. No oil or butter.  Natures hollow syrups use xylitol. Available online or at your health food store.  Sola is an
 erythritol blend I got at Amazon. Glycerin has similar calories to sugar but is low glycemic index and adds moisture. I like to make in cupcake form as it makes portion control easier ... score: 0.5441

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been experimenting with exactly this type of recipe for months! Here's what I've found works really well: Use a combination of oat flour (about 1 cup) with a small amount of cocoa powder (1/3 cup) as your dry base. For sweetener, I do a 50/50 mix of erythritol and stevia - the erythritol gives bulk and the stevia provides that clean sweetness without the cooling effect being too strong. The key to keeping them fudgy without going full keto is using unsweetened applesauce (about 1/2 cup) plus one whole egg and maybe 2-3 tablespoons of melted coconut oil or butter - just enough fat for texture but not excessive. I also add a tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water (let it sit for 5 minutes) as an egg replacer for extra binding. Bake at 325°F for about 22-25 minutes. They come out perfectly fudgy and each square has maybe 3-4g of natural sugars from the applesauce instead of 30g+ from regular sugar. The oat flour gives them a really nice, almost nutty flavor that pairs beautifully with dark chocolate chips if you want to add a few! ... score: 0.44858

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you're coming from! A lot of "sugar-free" brownie recipes end up being super high in fat or are technically keto, which isn't what everyone is looking for. I’ve had success making brownies with oat flour, Greek yogurt, and a blend of stevia and erythritol as sweeteners. The key to keeping them fudgy without all the fat is to use unsweetened applesauce or even mashed banana as part of the wet ingredients. For example, try 1 cup oat flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 1/3 cup applesauce, 2 eggs, and your sweetener combo to taste. Mix in a little espresso powder for a richer chocolate flavor if you like. Bake at 350°F for about 20-25 minutes—they’re not as oily as classic brownies but still come out fudge-like! ... score: 0.38363

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey there! I’ve been experimenting with brownies that are lower in sugar but still rich and fudgy, and I think I can help. Using oat flour is a great call for a bit more fiber and a milder flavor. For sweeteners, a combo of stevia and erythritol works well because erythritol adds bulk and a cooling effect, while stevia provides that intense sweetness without calories. I’d suggest starting with about 1/3 cup erythritol and 1/4 teaspoon liquid stevia (adjust to taste). For the fat, you can use a modest amount of applesauce or mashed banana to keep it moist without going heavy on butter or oil. Adding a little Greek yogurt can also boost moisture and give the brownie a tender crumb. Lastly, don’t overbake! Pull them out when a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs for that perfect fudgy texture. Hope this helps you nail the balance you’re looking for! ... score: 0.48227

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've been experimenting with sugar-free baking for a while now, and I think I can help you with that. One thing to keep in mind is that when using sugar-free sweeteners like stevia or erythritol, you may need to adjust the liquid content in the recipe. This is because these sweeteners can make the batter thicker and more prone to drying out. To combat this, you can try adding an extra egg or a little more oil to the recipe. As for the type of flour, oat flour is a great choice, but you can also experiment with almond flour or coconut flour for a different texture. I've found that a combination of oat flour and almond flour works well for fudgy brownies. ... score: 0.47952

Post: Fast 911 response!
Yesterday we were having lunch at the food trucks at Burnside and Park when we noticed a young woman near us fall to the ground having a seizure.

I called 911 expecting to be on hold for a long time but the call was answered immediately. The operator was very helpful and had an ambulance on the way in moments. Once we were sure the woman was stabilized and breathing regularly, the 911 operator ended the call. Within anther minute or two we heard the siren and I flagged down the ambulance to be sure they found us quickly.

I just wanted to share a positive story, I've heard lots of anecdotes about people waiting on hold for ages when calling 911. Maybe things were slow yesterday afternoon or something, but they were on it fast!

Also hope the lady who had the seizure is doing OK.

Reddit author comment: Two weeks ago, we (spouse and I) also had a very fast 911 response when assisting an emergency at NE Glisan and NE 57th, right where there is an entrance and exit ramp for I-84. There was a car stalled out blocking both the on- and off-ramps. The occupants were freaking out, screaming, running around the car, and one woman had only one shoe on. It seems like the young man in the car was having an asthma attack, but not sure. One woman called 911 while several of us pushed the car to a safe spot out of traffic. The ambulance came within 5 minutes. They had told the woman on the phone it would be 20 minutes, but they made it within 5. We were all SO grateful for this rapid response, and hopeful that the Portland 911 system is recovering and doing better. ... score: 0.54279

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is so refreshing to hear! I had a similar experience about six months ago when I witnessed a car accident on I-84. Called 911 expecting the worst based on all the horror stories you hear, but they picked up on the second ring and had units dispatched within minutes. I think a lot of the bad experiences people share online might be from peak hours or major incidents that tie up resources. It's also worth noting that different areas have different response capabilities - some districts are just better funded and staffed than others. Really glad you were there to help that woman and that everything worked out. It takes a village sometimes, and good Samaritans like you make all the difference.

Post: What would you do with all this produce? Tomatoes and lettuce pretty fresh, the rest of it less so
Pictured: 3 artichokes of questionable freshness, 5 wrinkly eggplants, about 10 fresh tomatoes, about 10 decent potatoes, 3 heads of romaine lettuce, an onion, and a decent zucchini. It all needs to be used pretty soon though! I only have 3 people to feed, and it needs to be vegetarian. Help!

Reddit author comment: I'd turn the eggplant into [baba ganoush](https://www.loveandlemons.com/baba-ganoush/#wprm-recipe-container-43084).

I like potatoes roasted. I usually slice into wedges, toss with olive oil, and season with salt, garlic powder, and za'atar, roast at 400F for 40 minutes, flipping/stirring halfway through (I can and will eat the entire pan of these). You can also slice the onion fairly thin and add it to this, pretty tasty.

The tomatoes, you could slice them for a salad with the lettuce (or sandwiches) or cook them down into a soup or sauce.

Zucchini you could turn into [zucchini bread](https://www.budgetbytes.com/zucchini-bread/), or if you have the other ingredients, [these muffins](https://thecheekychickpea.com/vegan-morning-glory-muffins/) are SO GOOD and freeze well (I just microwave them for 45 seconds for 1, or 1:30 for 2 straight from the freezer but I'd start with 30 seconds for 1/ 1 minute for 2 and see)

Those wrinkly eggplants are perfect for baba ganoush or roasted eggplant dip - just roast them whole until they're completely soft, then scoop out the flesh and blend with garlic, lemon, and tahini. The questionable artichokes can be salvaged if you trim off the outer leaves and use just the hearts in a pasta dish or risotto. For the fresh stuff, I'd make a huge batch of ratatouille using the eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and onion - it freezes beautifully and gets better with time. The potatoes could become a big batch of roasted potato salad, and those romaine heads would be perfect for Caesar salads to go alongside everything.

Serve that warm as a roasted veggie platter or mix it into pasta. For the artichokes, even if they’re not super fresh, you can try steaming them, then scraping out the edible parts and making an artichoke dip with some cheese, lemon, and breadcrumbs. The tomatoes and romaine are perfect for a big, fresh salad—throw in some croutons, maybe a basic vinaigrette, and you have a meal. If you need to use things up quickly, you could also simmer the tomatoes into a sauce to use over the roasted veggies or pasta.

The artichokes might be a bit tricky if they’re not super fresh, but you could try steaming or boiling them, then serving with a lemon-garlic dipping sauce. Potatoes are super versatile—consider making crispy roasted potatoes seasoned with paprika and garlic or even a hearty potato and vegetable stew to stretch everything out.

Post: What creative things can channel points be redeemed for?
I recently reached affiliate status on Twitch, which is a milestone for me. However, I'm not sure what can be redeemed with channel points. I generally stream Fortnite. Does anyone have any ideas?

Reddit author comment: It really depends on how technical and in depth you want to get with it. There are heaps of simple things you can think of yourself like little challenges etc. You can go from just having to do something yourself or change something manually on the stream, to automating some ridiculous things using bots and effects.

For example I have a redeem called Mugshot where people can enter custom text and it will then change to a scene where I have background removal on my camera so I appear in front of a criminal line up wall with the custom text appearing on a small board in front of me that says "Chat Police Dept." like it's what I'm being charged with, then after 2 seconds it freeze frames the camera with a camera shutter sound and iron bars slide into the scene from either side with a "cell doors being slammed shut" sound effect. Then it goes back to whatever scene I was on before. People really love that one but I have heaps more like that.

You could also do "Streamer has to sing next victory royale" or "Chat controls my keybinds for 2 minutes" (if you're feeling brave). The key is making rewards that create interaction and entertainment value. Start with cheaper point costs and adjust based on how often they're redeemed.

Post: Is UV package manager taking over?
Hi!
I am a devops engineer and notice developers talking about uv package manager.  I used it today for the first time and loved it. It seems like everyone is talking to agrees. Does anyone have and cons for us package manager?

Reddit author comment: I may be too late to this party but my thoughts are that having something like this in the python ecosystem that is written in Rust may be great for end-users but may also be a problem for the community.  
  
The barrier to entry to contribute to uv is going to be high and that is going to vastly limit the number of python community members that can contribute. "Open" is more than just a license.

Sure builds are faster - but how often do you do that in your daily life?  
Maybe microservice deployment-on-demand or CI tooling need super-fast build/packaging.

So as someone who likes to contribute to OSS projects I'd rather see the vast majority of uv's capabilities written in python with maybe things like a focused dependency solver in Rust. ... score: 0.52745

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been using uv for about 6 months now and honestly, it's been a game changer for our team's Python workflow. The speed improvement alone is worth the switch - dependency resolution that used to take 2-3 minutes with pip now happens in seconds. However, there are definitely some cons to consider. First, it's still relatively new, so you might run into edge cases that aren't well documented yet. We had issues with some legacy packages that had weird dependency specifications. Second, if your team is heavily invested in conda environments or has complex scientific computing needs, the transition might be more painful. Also, while uv handles most use cases beautifully, I've noticed it can be less forgiving with malformed package metadata compared to pip's more lenient approach. That said, the pros far outweigh the cons in my experience. The lock file functionality is excellent, and the fact that it can replace multiple tools (pip, pip-tools, virtualenv) makes our CI/CD pipelines much cleaner. Just make sure to test thoroughly in your staging environment before rolling it out to production workflows. ... score: 0.46432

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I’ve been following the UV package manager’s progress pretty closely, and I agree it’s generating a lot of hype, especially on Twitter and in Python circles. The main pros that people rave about are its speed (it’s written in Rust, after all), deterministic lock files, and the fact that it’s aiming to be a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools, which is super convenient. On the con side, though, I’d say the biggest issue right now is that it’s still very new. That means it might not cover every edge case or obscure workflow, and integration with some existing CI/CD tools or plugins can be hit-or-miss. Documentation is good but not as mature as pip or poetry. Also, some people have mentioned that because it’s evolving so fast, there might be breaking changes or bugs that haven’t been ironed out yet. If you’re running critical production systems, I’d recommend testing thoroughly before switching over completely. But it’s definitely one to watch! ... score: 0.47157

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: As someone who's been in the devops space for a while, I can say UV package manager is definitely gaining momentum, and for good reasons. Its speed and lightweight nature make it a solid choice compared to some of the older, bulkier managers out there. The dependency resolution feels smarter and less prone to conflicts, which is a breath of fresh air. That said, it’s still relatively new, so the ecosystem and community support aren’t as mature as something like npm or pip. Some edge cases and less common packages might have issues or lack support. Also, documentation can sometimes be sparse or overly technical for newcomers. But overall, it’s a promising tool that might very well take over in the future if it keeps evolving and addressing these minor pain points. ... score: 0.47469

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who has been following the development of UV package manager, I think it's interesting to see how it's gaining traction in the developer community. One of the key benefits of UV is its ability to simplify the package management process, making it easier for developers to focus on writing code rather than managing dependencies. The fact that UV is designed to be highly customizable also makes it an attractive option for teams with specific needs. However, I do think that there are some potential downsides to consider. For example, UV is still a relatively new tool, and as such, it may not have the same level of community support as more established package managers. Additionally, some users have reported issues with compatibility and stability, which could be a concern for large-scale projects. Overall, I think UV has a lot of potential, but it's essential to carefully evaluate its pros and cons before deciding whether to adopt it. ... score: 0.44213

However, one con I've noticed is that it doesn't have as many features as some of the more established package managers like NPM or Yarn. For example, it doesn't have as many built-in tools for package optimization or dependency resolution. But overall, I think it's a great option for smaller projects or teams that prefer a more minimalist approach. ... score: 0.53017

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I've been using UV for a few months now, and while it's definitely a game-changer in terms of speed and ease of use, there are a few cons that I think are worth mentioning. First, the ecosystem is still relatively new, so the number of available packages and community support is not as extensive as more established package managers like npm or pip. This can be a bit of a hurdle if you're working on a project that relies on a lot of niche or specialized dependencies. Additionally, the documentation, while improving, is still not as comprehensive as some other tools. I've found myself having to dig through GitHub issues and community forums more often than I'd like. Lastly, there are occasional stability issues, especially with the latest versions, which can be a bit frustrating. However, the team behind UV is very active and responsive, so these issues are usually addressed quickly. Overall, I'd say it's a solid choice, but it might not be the best fit for every project just yet. ... score: 0.45025

Post: Documentaries or Film Suggestions
Hi! I'm very interested in the history of Berlin, particularly the history of youth culture in music and art. Are there any documentaries or movies you can point me to that explore the lives of interesting artists or unique eras in music, media, fashion, or a similar topic? So far in my quest to find more info on it, I'm getting the impression that this isn't that well documented? Any documentaries about perhaps how the Berlin wall and its fall impacted the arts and nightlife scene would be cool too!

Reddit author comment: Not a documentary but I really recommend the book about Schleimkeim: the famous east German punkband which openly criticized the GDR.


Otze Ehrlich (Leader) had a pretty interesting life. Grew up in the GDR as a punk, played crazy shows in churches, got hassled and imprisoned by the Stasi. He later moved to Berlin and there were rumors he acted as a kind of double agent as well. 
There's stories about fights with skinheads, outer body experience, the former Tacheles and Berlin at the time. Just a fun read and personal account on how musicians and artists lived at the time.


Definitely can recommend. ... score: 0.52584

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're absolutely right that Berlin's youth culture history isn't as well-documented as it should be, but there are some gems out there! I'd highly recommend "B-Movie: Lust & Sound in West-Berlin 1979-1989" - it's a fantastic documentary that captures the underground music and art scene in West Berlin during the final decade before the wall came down. It features interviews with musicians, artists, and club kids who lived through that wild era. Also check out "Blank Generation" which has some great Berlin footage from the late 70s punk scene. For the post-wall period, "Berlin Calling" isn't a documentary but it's a pretty authentic portrayal of the techno scene that exploded after reunification. The documentary "Tresor Berlin: The Vault and the Electronic Frontier" specifically covers how the fall of the wall led to the birth of Berlin's legendary techno scene in abandoned buildings and bunkers. These should give you a solid foundation to explore further! ... score: 0.50198

gpt4.1-instruct comment: If you haven’t already checked it out, I highly recommend the documentary “B-Movie: Lust & Sound in West-Berlin 1979–1989.” It’s an absolute gem that captures the wild creativity of Berlin’s post-punk, new wave, and industrial scenes before the wall fell. The film mixes archival footage, interviews, and personal stories, giving you a real sense of what it was like to be young and artistically alive in a divided city. Another suggestion is “Berlin Calling,” a fictional film but heavily inspired by the electronic music scene that exploded post-reunification. For documentary series, Arte has some great retrospectives on German youth culture, though some are in German with subtitles. And if you want to dive into techno, “After the Fall” and “Sound of Berlin” both explore how the fall of the Wall led to the city’s legendary club culture. ... score: 0.58596

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey! If you're diving into Berlin's youth culture and arts history, especially around the Wall and its fall, you should definitely check out the documentary *"Berlin Babylon"*. It explores the city's architectural transformation post-Wall but also touches on the cultural shifts happening underneath. For a deeper dive into music and nightlife, *"Berliner Syndrome"* (not a documentary, but a film capturing the city's vibe) might interest you. Also, *"Speaking in Code"* looks at Berlin’s techno scene, which exploded after reunification and became a huge part of youth culture. You're right that some eras are less documented, but the post-Wall period's underground clubs and art scenes have been increasingly spotlighted lately.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a historian with a focus on cultural movements, I must say that the history of youth culture in Berlin, particularly in the realms of music and art, is indeed a fascinating and complex topic. While it's true that comprehensive documentation might be scarce, there are several documentaries and films that offer valuable insights into this era. For instance, the documentary "B-Movie: Lust & Sound in West Berlin 1979-1989" provides an in-depth look at the city's vibrant music and art scene during the 1980s, featuring interviews with key figures such as Nick Cave and Blixa Bargeld. Another noteworthy film is "We Children from Bahnhof Zoo," which, although not exclusively focused on the arts, offers a poignant portrayal of the city's youth culture during the late 1970s and early 1980s, touching upon themes of identity, rebellion, and the struggle for self-expression. The impact of the Berlin Wall and its fall on the arts and nightlife scene is also a compelling subject, with documentaries like "The Wall" and "Berlin Calling" offering unique perspectives on how this pivotal event influenced the city's cultural landscape. ... score: 0.55917

It’s a fascinating look at how the city’s divided history shaped the creative community. Another must-see is "Bummerland" (2019), which explores the underground club scene and the rise of techno music. It features interviews with key figures who were instrumental in shaping Berlin’s nightlife, providing a behind-the-scenes look at how the fall of the Wall led to a creative explosion. For a more personal and intimate perspective, "Love, Karl" (2017) is a compelling film that follows Karl Lagerfeld’s life and his connection to Berlin. While it’s not solely about Berlin, it gives a unique insight into how the city influenced his work. These documentaries should give you a well-rounded view of Berlin’s rich cultural history and the dynamic changes it has undergone. ... score: 0.61064

Post: Someone misused and broke thermometer with Mercury, what do I do?
Hi, so I'm currently watching over a chemistry laboratory, and one of the grad students broke an old thermometer with mercury.

She tried covering it up, by First: wiping it with Aluminum Foil. Second: She also tried to mop it.

She never told the other groups in the lab and I only found out when I saw the Foil Melting/Reacting weirdly in the room.

Idk how long we were exposed to the mercury because the student ran as soon as I found out. 

I threw away the mop and tried to use tape to remove the bits of meecury I saw.

Should I be worried? Is it possible that I inhaled mercury within the time period that we were oblivious to the accident? The room was airconditioned and as far as I know, there wasn't any other heat applied to the mercury asied from maybe the magnetic stirrer it was initially on before breaking...

Will it seep through our shoes or skin if ever we didn't notice and accidentally came into contact with it? Maybe perhaps the air as vapor?

Reddit author comment: Not a chemist but did study chemistry and did break a thermometer before.

Mercury is toxic but not THAT toxic where everyone has to clear the room.  The broken glass is more of a hazard if anything. 

Use a business or key card to scrape up all the Mercury you can see. open the windows and use a fan to air out for a while and you should be good.

As for the student. They need to understand that they need to bring it up so that it can be called for properly and there shouldn't be any punishment for an accident, as their safety is much more important. Imagine if it was a broken Bunsen burner hose where it could have an immediate danger ... score: 0.54619

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Holy shit, this is a serious situation and you need to act NOW, not ask Reddit. Mercury vapor is extremely toxic and the fact that someone tried to cover this up is absolutely insane. First, evacuate the lab immediately and seal it off - put up signs, lock the door, whatever you need to do to keep people out. Contact your institution's environmental health and safety office RIGHT NOW, like call their emergency line if they have one. If not, call your local hazmat team or poison control center. Mercury vapor is invisible and odorless, and it accumulates in your body over time causing serious neurological damage. The aluminum foil reaction you saw is concerning because it suggests there was significant mercury present. Don't try to clean this up yourself with tape - you're just spreading it around and making it worse. Professional hazmat cleanup is required here. Document everything, take photos if it's safe to do so, and report that grad student immediately. This kind of coverup could have seriously injured or killed people. Get yourself and anyone else who was exposed to a doctor ASAP for baseline testing. Mercury poisoning symptoms can take time to appear, so don't assume you're fine just because you feel okay now. ... score: 0.56523

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Wow, this is a pretty serious situation—mercury spills are nothing to mess around with, especially in a closed, air-conditioned lab. Mercury vapor is toxic and can be harmful, particularly in poorly ventilated spaces. Trying to clean it up with a mop or aluminum foil is actually the opposite of what you're supposed to do, as it can spread the mercury around and, as you noticed, aluminum reacts with mercury, which can create its own problems. The best practice for mercury spills is to use a mercury spill kit, which usually has special powders and tools to safely collect the droplets. You should definitely notify your lab supervisor and EHS (Environmental Health & Safety) right away so they can assess how much mercury remains and whether any special cleanup is needed. Also, let everyone who was in the room know about the exposure so they’re aware of potential symptoms. If you’re worried about inhaled mercury, you might want to get checked out by occupational health—chronic exposure can cause symptoms over time even if you don’t feel anything right away. ... score: 0.56604

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Oh man, that sounds like a really stressful situation. Mercury vapor is definitely hazardous, especially in enclosed spaces like a lab. Since mercury evaporates at room temperature, it’s possible that some vapor was released and inhaled, which can be harmful even in small amounts. The fact that the room was air-conditioned helps somewhat with ventilation, but it really depends on how long the mercury was exposed. I’d recommend evacuating the area immediately and informing your institution’s environmental health and safety office or hazardous materials team. They usually have the right equipment for proper mercury spill cleanup, like mercury spill kits with sulfur powder or specialized vacuums. Also, make sure everyone who was in the lab gets checked out for any exposure symptoms—tremors, headaches, or respiratory issues—though symptoms might not show immediately. For future reference, NEVER use tape or regular mops on mercury spills since it can spread the droplets and increase exposure. Stay safe and get professional help ASAP! ... score: 0.57992

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm not a medical professional, but I've had some experience with mercury spills in the past, and I can offer some general advice. When mercury is spilled, it's essential to contain it as quickly as possible to prevent it from spreading and vaporizing. The fact that the student used aluminum foil and a mop to try to clean it up is concerning, as these methods can actually make the situation worse. Aluminum foil can react with mercury to form a toxic compound, and mopping can spread the mercury around, making it harder to clean up. Given that you've already taken some steps to contain the spill, such as throwing away the mop and using tape to remove the visible mercury, it's crucial to take further precautions to ensure everyone's safety. I would recommend sealing off the area and ventilating it to prevent the mercury vapors from spreading. It's also essential to inform the other groups in the lab about the incident and provide them with guidance on what to do next. Regarding your concerns about inhaling mercury, it's possible that you may have been exposed, especially since the room was air-conditioned. However, the extent of the exposure depends on various factors, such as the amount of mercury spilled and the duration of the exposure. I would recommend monitoring your health closely and seeking medical attention if you experience any symptoms such as headaches or dizziness. Additionally, it's essential to take precautions to prevent any further exposure, such as wearing protective gear, including gloves and masks, when handling any potentially contaminated materials. It's also important to note that mercury can seep through skin and shoes if not properly contained, so it's crucial to take steps to prevent any further contact. ... score: 0.56403

Tell me something about your tank(s) that you’ve found yourself really enjoying or has made you happy lately.

I recently changed the stock in my 75 gallon tank. I decided to stock the tank with rainbow fish. I have a group of 7 boesemani’s and 7 turquoise along with 2 blood parrots. I never realized how beautiful rainbow fish are. They are very active and I love watching the colors on them develop.

Post: Kendrick Laser Show
Looking to go to the Kendrick laser show at the pacific science center. 

1. I’ve never been, what a should I expect?

2. I can’t find a list of songs anywhere… does anyone know what they play?

TIA!

Reddit author comment: No idea what songs are in it, but here's the basics. The show is on an enormous domed ceiling. There are theater seats in the rear, and a sloped, carpeted floor down front that people lay down on. Do whatever's comfortable, but laying on the floor causes it to really fill your entire field of vision!

Also walk up to the booth in the back before the show and check out the controls. Some of the show is programmed ahead of time and just "played with" by the performer, some is completely live, and they're expected to learn the layout well enough that, at least almost all the time, they can keep their eyes on the dome. It takes quite a bit of time and training to do that job.

By the way, during the World's Fair, this room was the Boeing Spacearium, and had a big projector set into the floor which showed a simulated trip to the moon and back.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I went to the Kendrick laser show at PSC about six months ago and it was absolutely incredible! You should expect to lie back in those reclining seats in the dome theater while lasers dance across the entire ceiling in sync with Kendrick's music. The sound system is phenomenal - you really feel the bass in your chest. The show runs about 45 minutes and features a mix of his biggest hits and some deeper cuts. They dim all the lights so it's completely dark except for the lasers, which creates this really immersive experience. The lasers are perfectly choreographed to match the beats and lyrics - during "HUMBLE." the visuals were insane. I'd recommend getting there a bit early to get good seats in the center of the dome for the best viewing angle. Also, don't expect to use your phone much since it's pretty dark and you'll want to just take it all in. Definitely worth the ticket price if you're a Kendrick fan! ... score: 0.62362

The vibe is super chill—people just recline in these comfy seats and let the lasers and visuals wash over them while Kendrick’s music plays. Expect a lot of trippy, colorful patterns and iconic imagery synced up to the beats. As for the setlist, they usually play some of his biggest hits—"HUMBLE.", "DNA.", "King Kunta", and "Alright" are almost always on there. They sometimes throw in older tracks too, but the selection can change from show to show. If you’re a fan, you’ll definitely recognize most of what you hear.

The thing is absolutely massive now - we've had to repot it into increasingly larger containers, and it currently lives in what's basically a small barrel planter. Every November without fail, it explodes into the most gorgeous pink blooms that last for weeks. The secret seems to be benign neglect honestly - we water it maybe once every two weeks, keep it in bright indirect light, and give it a cool period in fall to trigger blooming.

What's amazing is that it's been through several moves, and I've even forgotten to water it a few times, but it always bounces back. I've had to prune it a few times to keep it from getting too leggy, but other than that, it's been relatively low maintenance. I've also noticed that it's become more resilient over time, and can survive with less water and more neglect than my other plants. I think that's one of the reasons why jade trees are so popular - they're tough, adaptable, and can thrive in a variety of conditions.

Post: Which chemistry set would you recommend?
I am a non-professional chemist and I am looking for a set of chemicals. About six years ago I got a chemistry kit. I have the equipment, however I don't have many chemicals. Idealy, I would want a kit of chemicals, that aren't in big quantities (such as 1kg) and I can do interesting experiments with them. Can you recommend a chemistry set? 

Thanks in advance!

Reddit author comment: My chemistry set consists of Amazon, aliexpress, ebay, walmart, canadian tire, home depot.... And a credit card.

"Interesting" really depends on what you want to do. To me, what's more important than the physical chemicals is the knowledge of how to get a reaction out of them. I pick a reaction i want to do, say make sodium metal, and then i go find the chemicals for it. In my case drain cleaner, magnesium firestarters, baby oil, menthol crystals, and energizer batteries. Then with some time and effort, i turn that into sodium metal... which i then throw into a bucket of water and make them explode.

If you're looking around for chemistry sets, see if you can download and review the manual first. That's the real gem of the set. See if the experiments are interesting and the kinds you want to do.

Alternatively, don't even get the set, see if you can source the individual chemicals domestically, thats a whole adventure in itself. 

Granted, my way might be a little expensive, i think i've blown maybe $80k on my hobby so far. ... score: 0.51772

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from - having the glassware but needing to restock on chemicals is a common situation. I'd highly recommend checking out **The Science Company** or **United Nuclear** for smaller quantities of reagents. They sell chemicals in much more reasonable amounts (like 25g-100g bottles) which is perfect for home experimentation. For interesting experiments, I'd suggest getting basics like copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium carbonate, citric acid, and some indicator solutions. You could also look into **Carolina Biological Supply** - they have educational chemical sets that come with smaller quantities specifically designed for demonstrations and experiments. Another great option is **Flinn Scientific**, though they primarily sell to educators, you might be able to purchase through them if you explain your educational interest. Just remember to always follow proper safety protocols, have good ventilation, and check your local regulations about chemical storage and disposal.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you're coming from! It's surprisingly tricky to find kits that provide just the chemicals without all the basic equipment. Most modern "chemistry sets" marketed for adults seem to focus on safety and simple experiments, so they often only include small quantities of fairly mundane chemicals. If you're looking for a wider variety, I’d recommend checking out Home Science Tools—they sell a bunch of individual chemicals in small bottles (like 30g or 100g), and you can build your own set based on what interests you. Just be aware of the legal restrictions in your area; some compounds are regulated or require you to state your intended use. Another option is Thames & Kosmos’ "Chem C3000," which is one of the most advanced kits you can buy, though it’s still limited compared to what you remember from older chemistry sets. If you’re comfortable handling chemicals safely and have the right storage solutions, piecing together your own collection is probably the most satisfying route! ... score: 0.37048

Companies like Thames & Kosmos or Scientific Explorer sometimes offer refill kits with small bottles of common reagents like copper sulfate, phenolphthalein, or sodium bicarbonate in quantities of 10-50 grams, which are perfect for home experiments. Another option is to buy chemicals individually from reputable online suppliers that cater to educators or hobby chemists—just be sure to check their shipping restrictions and safety guidelines.

Post: Hardest trails within a 2-3 hour drive of Philadelphia?
Me and my friend have been doing hiking trips for a while now, and we have another coming up soon and I’m in charge of planning the hike. Me and him like more difficult trails and typically the most difficult/hardest haven’t been anything hard, just typically a little narrower or longer distance. So I want to find an actually hard trail that we can do and take. So I want to know if anyone knows any hard or treacherous trails within a 2-3 hour drive of Philadelphia? (3 hours max)

Also side note: why are hard trails easy to do with no break but the second you get on the paved trail back to the parking lot, you’re legs just give out and you feel like this paved road is harder than the trail?

Reddit author comment: Glen Onokos Falls but I believe the trail is closed to the public. However, I believe it was closed to the public last time I went back in 2020 and you definitely couldn't tell with the amount of people who were there hiking it. Things may have changed since then though.

EDIT: Also wanted to add a two more suggestions.

World's End State Park. I don't remember the names of the specific trails but I hike a few about 10 years ago and remember them being pretty difficult, at least for trails in PA.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Dude, you NEED to check out the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock loop in Berks County - it's about 1.5 hours from Philly and will absolutely kick your ass. The trail itself is around 8.5 miles with some seriously steep, rocky sections that'll have you scrambling over boulders. What makes it brutal isn't just the distance, but the constant elevation changes and the fact that the trail is basically just rocks for long stretches. Your ankles will be screaming by the end. The views are incredible though - totally worth the pain. If you want something even more challenging, try doing it in reverse or add on the side trail to the Hamburg Reservoir for extra miles. Fair warning though, the descent can be harder than the ascent because of all the loose rock. And to answer your side note - it's because your muscles are already fatigued and the hard pavement doesn't absorb impact like dirt trails do, so your legs are basically getting pounded with every step when they're already toast! ... score: 0.43157

It’s right around that 3-hour mark, but it’s notorious for being one of the toughest hikes in the Northeast. The whole thing is about 24 miles with around 9,000 feet of elevation gain, but you can do a shorter section (like the western half) if you’re not up for the full trek. It’s super rugged, with lots of steep ascents and descents, scrambles, and some exposure. Locally, the Pinnacle and Pulpit Rock loop (near Hamburg, PA) isn’t as long or hard, but it’s got some good climbs and rocky terrain. As for the paved trail thing, I think it’s a mental shift—you’re in “go mode” on the rugged stuff, but the second you hit the pavement your brain knows you’re almost done and lets your guard down, so all the fatigue hits at once! ... score: 0.38384

Another option is the Appalachian Trail sections near Hawk Mountain or the Lehigh Gorge Trail, where you can combine elevation changes with rugged terrain. For something a bit more remote and wild, portions of the Loyalsock State Forest trails in PA are notoriously tough with a lot of elevation gain and uneven footing. As for your side note about paved trails feeling harder after a hike, it’s actually pretty common—your leg muscles get used to the uneven, varied terrain on the trail, engaging stabilizers and different muscle groups. When you switch to flat pavement, those muscles don’t get the same engagement, and your legs can feel fatigued or awkward, making it seem harder even though the surface is easier. Also, downhill on pavement can be surprisingly tough on your knees and quads, which might add to that feeling. Hope you find a trail that really challenges you guys! ... score: 0.43641

Reddit author comment: Here's the thing: 100 Girlfriends, by its premise alone, should *not* work. At all. And not just because the idea of having so many main characters is a completely absurd notion, but also because it is surprisingly hard for romcoms to remain both romantic and comedic for very long, least of all one that needs to introduce a new character every other episode.

But somehow, against all the odds, this show struck gold and kept digging until it unearthed harem anime Shangri-La. Where a lesser show might have undercut all previous girlfriends with each new one that is introduced, 100 Girlfriends leverages those introductions as a way to shake up and add to existing character dynamics in a way that exponentially increases their unique appeal. Karane alone is one of the most amazing characters I've ever seen in an anime because the show is constantly demanding that she play against type as the archetypical tsundere who clearly still deeply loves every member of the Rentaro Family. And while 100 Girlfriends Season 1 blew me away when it was airing a year ago, Season 2 has somehow *surpassed* it in both hilarity and sincerity.
