Post: grieving my pre-ocd self
i know i technically was never a pre-ocd version of myself, but it was minor for most of my life but worsened very quickly and severely when i was 18 (20 now). my ocd is based around contamination and i think about when i was able to do things that i now deem gross, like touching doorknobs, using another person's pencils or class supplies, tying my shoes.. just wondering if there is anyone else whose ocd developed a bit "later" and can relate

Reddit author comment: Totally feel you on this. I’m 24 and didn’t “feel or have” symptoms till I was like 20. I miss the things I used to be able to do without a second thought like taking meds when I’m sick or eating out at a restaurant. There are so many things that my 18 year old self did that would genuinely send me into a full crash out now. Asking a random mom for advil, taking a sip of a friends drink at the bar, leaving my house without unplugging everything bc what if it causes a fire, ANY recreational drugs. Used to smoke weed a lot and now I’d rather die than take the smallest baby toke. No real concrete event that caused the switch either, just got to a point where I started to notice myself avoiding things I once did and got worse from there and gets worse every day tbh. I fear it will just keep getting worse. ... score: 0.19973

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I completely understand this feeling and you're definitely not alone in experiencing OCD that intensified later in life. I'm 24 now and mine really ramped up around 19-20, also with contamination themes. Before that, I had some quirks but nothing that really interfered with my daily life. Now I look back at photos of myself casually eating food at restaurants, touching public surfaces without a second thought, or sharing drinks with friends and it feels like watching a different person entirely. There's this weird grief that comes with it - mourning a version of yourself that felt more carefree and spontaneous. I think what makes it harder is that we have these vivid memories of being able to do things that now feel impossible, which can make the contrast feel even more stark. It's important to remember that recovery is possible though, and many people do get back to doing things they once enjoyed. The brain is remarkably adaptable, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Have you been able to connect with any treatment resources? ERP therapy has helped me reclaim some of those activities, even if the process feels scary at first. ... score: 0.29505

My OCD didn’t really start impacting my life until I got to college, right around 19, and before that I never even thought twice about a lot of the things that are now daily hurdles for me. I also have contamination themes, and it’s wild looking back at old photos or memories and realizing how carefree I used to be about things like sharing drinks or not washing my hands after touching public stuff. Sometimes I feel grief too—it’s like mourning a version of yourself that you can’t get back to, and that’s a real, valid feeling.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey, I totally get where you’re coming from. My OCD also got a lot worse in my late teens, even though it was barely noticeable before then. It’s such a strange feeling to look back at your “pre-OCD” days and realize how different life felt—like you had this freedom that now feels almost impossible to regain. For me, contamination fears became super intense out of nowhere, and everyday things like touching public surfaces or sharing items became overwhelming. It’s okay to grieve that version of yourself because it was real and meaningful, even if OCD wasn’t as present then. You’re definitely not alone in experiencing this shift later on, and it’s okay to mourn what feels lost while still working toward managing your symptoms now. Hang in there! ... score: 0.25637

As someone who's struggled with anxiety and depression, I've had to come to terms with the fact that my mental health journey is not linear, and that it's okay to grieve the person I used to be. It's interesting that you mention your OCD developing later in life, because I've heard that it's often triggered by significant life changes or stressors.

The anxiety around contamination is so intense, and it's hard to explain to people who don't have it. I remember feeling so lost and overwhelmed, like I was losing pieces of myself. It's a grieving process, for sure. But know that you're not alone in this. There are so many of us out there who understand and can support you.

Post: Asymmetric grandparents, in-laws uninterested
Anybody else with one set of grandparents who are just kind of duds? My in-laws say they want to see our kids and clearly take pride in being grandparents, but whenever they're here they just kind of dawdle around in the orbit of our children and only seem to have motivation to *be* grandparents sporadically.

We have a 3 year old and a set of twins who are ~10 months, so it definitely can be a lot to be around them at times, but their other grandparents (my parents) are always super hands-on and asking when they can get more time and what they can do to help.

My wife has noticed the difference, it clearly bothers her, and I don't know what to do about it. Frankly, it bugs the shit out of me, but I don't want to pile on or feed into a negative cycle, so I just try to frame it as them trying their best while validating that I've noticed it.

Anybody been in a similar situation and how did it pan out?



Reddit author comment: My dad absolutely adores our two boys, but when he flew across the country to visit us a year and a half ago, I swear he spent 90% of the time just sitting on our couch staring at his phone. He missed several dinners with us because he was passed out on the couch asleep. It was like pulling teeth getting him to actually come out of the house and do things with us (He's in his late 60s but uses the "I'm old" excuse like he in his 80s), and he kept trying to put the tv on (when we said no more tv) so our boys would leave their playroom and some sit in the living room with him. It was actually really disappointing. I remember my grandpa making picnics with me, playing board games with me, taking me to fun places when we'd visit. And my dad could barely get off the couch or put his phone down the whole time. ... score: 0.20148

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, this hits so close to home it's almost painful to read. We've been dealing with this exact dynamic for about 5 years now with our two kids. My parents are the hands-on ones - they're constantly asking to babysit, they remember every little milestone, they actually get down on the floor and play with the kids. Meanwhile, my husband's parents show up, sit on the couch, maybe hold the baby for like 10 minutes if we literally place the child in their arms, and then just... exist. They'll say things like "oh we should see the grandkids more" but when we invite them over or suggest activities, there's always some excuse or they come but act like they're doing us this huge favor. The worst part is watching my kids notice the difference as they get older. My 7-year-old has started asking why Grandma and Grandpa [my parents] always want to play but the other grandparents just watch TV. It's heartbreaking honestly. I've tried talking to my husband about it, and he sees it too, but there's only so much you can do to force someone to be engaged.

It’s so awkward because my partner can see the difference and it makes her sad that my folks aren’t more eager to engage with the kids. At first I got defensive, but honestly, once I stepped back I realized it really is just their personalities and comfort levels. Some people just aren’t “kid people,” even if they want to be. We tried inviting them to specific activities, like reading a book or helping with snack time, instead of just asking them to “spend time.” Sometimes having clear roles or little tasks helped them engage more, but ultimately, we’ve just accepted that the involvement will never be symmetrical. It’s tough, but focusing on the positive relationships and not forcing the awkward ones has kept our stress level down. You’re not alone in this! ... score: 0.28563

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from. We have a similar dynamic with my in-laws and my own parents. My parents are constantly involved, offering to babysit, bringing over meals, and genuinely excited to engage with the kids. Meanwhile, my in-laws seem to show up more out of obligation or for short visits and don’t really step up much beyond that. It’s tough because you want your kids to have meaningful relationships with all grandparents, but it feels like you’re forcing it with the less engaged side. What helped us was having an honest conversation (gently) with the in-laws about what kind of support or involvement would actually mean a lot to us and the kids. Sometimes people don’t realize how their actions come across or what’s expected of them. It didn’t turn everything around overnight, but it opened the door for more intentional visits and activities. Also, focusing on quality over quantity—like suggesting specific outings or routines—can help.

We've had some honest conversations with them, just gently letting them know how we feel and how much it would mean to us if they were more involved. They've tried to step up a bit, but it's still not the same. I think the key is to keep the lines of communication open and keep trying to find common ground. It's a delicate balance, but it's worth it for the sake of the kids and the family dynamic.

Post: Winter weather for Portland no longer predicted by major weather models
There was a post a few days back warning of a distant chance of winter weather, but no significant plunge in temperatures is in the long-range forecast anymore for next 30 days, into mid-February, meaning we could have an essentially winterless winter, although late freezes are always possible.

[Rod Hill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMJb-SD4WXs) put it in a layman-friendly video on his personal YouTube channel.

KOIN's [Josh Cozart](https://www.youtube.com/@joshcozartwx) also has a YouTube channel, Mark Nelsen has his [blog](https://www.kptv.com/weather/blog/), and the KPTV weather team has a [podcast](https://www.kptv.com/podcasts/weather/). You can also get 7-day forecasts on the main [KOIN](https://www.youtube.com/@KOINLOCAL6), [KGW](https://www.youtube.com/@KGWNews8), and [KPTV](https://www.youtube.com/@Fox12oregon) YouTube channels.

If you know of another source of Portland weather info that provides something more than the typical maps and apps, please share!

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Honestly, this is both a relief and deeply concerning at the same time. On one hand, I'm grateful I won't have to deal with the usual Portland winter chaos - no ice storms knocking out power for days, no frozen pipes, no sliding down hills in my car because the city owns like three snow plows total. My heating bill is definitely thanking whatever climate patterns are keeping us mild. But on the other hand, this feels really wrong for February in the Pacific Northwest. I've lived here for over 20 years and while our winters were never Minnesota-brutal, we usually got at least a few proper cold snaps and maybe some snow in the gorge. The fact that we're looking at essentially spring weather through mid-February is honestly kind of terrifying from a climate change perspective.

Post: Last classes were today and students added me on social media
Today was the last day of classes and 2 of my favorite students requested to follow me on Instagram. Completely great and mature kids and I want to accept the requests, but I feel like the smart move is to wait till they graduate (they just finished 9th grade). Any advice on how to handle this? This is my first year of teaching and haven't handled this so far. 

Reddit author comment: You could take my approach and just not have social media. I've gotten rid of my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, and can't say my life is noticeably worse for having done so; Facebook is nice to find out what happened to the people wmyoi went to high school with, but then you eventually realize why you weren't friends with everyone, anyway. Plus, these companies make money on any data you give them, data which compromises your personal privacy, lets companies engage in differential pricing and marketing, and has the power to sway elections (at least, if we believe the social research that's trickling out, now).

So, to my mind, the easiest answer to them asking is "I don't have it, here's why," because you not only answer the question in a way they can't wheedle in, but start a conversation about an important issue they probably never thought of.

Even with your absolute favorite, most mature students, it's just better to maintain that professional boundary while they're still enrolled at your school. Social media can get messy - you might see posts about parties, drama between students, or even just typical teenage stuff that could put you in an awkward position later. What I usually do is tell students something like "I'd love to connect after you graduate! Hit me up then and we can follow each other." Most kids totally understand and respect that boundary.

It feels really flattering when students want to connect with you outside of school, especially the ones you’ve built a good rapport with. However, I would strongly recommend holding off on accepting their requests until after they graduate. Even if they’re mature, there are still professional boundaries to consider, and school policies (and parents!) can get really particular about this kind of thing. What I usually do is politely let students know that I don’t accept current students on my personal social media, but once they graduate, I’d be happy to connect. This keeps things professional and sets a good example. Plus, you never know what might happen in the future, so it’s best to err on the side of caution.

Waiting until they graduate is a good move because it helps keep your relationship strictly professional while they’re still under your authority. In the meantime, you can always keep the connection positive in class and encourage them to reach out through school channels if they ever need help.

Post: Saw Sonny Boy And...I'm Not Sure How I Feel About It
The show was definitely interesting with its characters and bizarre setting, but that ending...just kinda left this empty feeling inside me. I don't think I felt this way since "Angel Beats". 

Also can someone explain how Nozami "died" in episode 10? Like why couldn't Asakaze use his power right there!? I was so confused!

Reddit author comment: I wasn’t a huge fan of Sonny Boy personally. I respect what it was going for, but it just felt kind of “hollow”, for lack of a better term. While I think the ideas it was trying to tackle were interesting, once you “get” that this is all just a metaphor for the confusion of growing up and entering the wider world you realize that there really isn’t much else to it. The story, world and characters are all incredibly vague and ill defined, and while this may be intentional, it still leads to it being difficult to give much of a shit about any of the characters or anything that happens. 

Finally, the ending was just incredibly unsatisfying in my opinion. The defense of this is  usually “it was supposed to be unsatisfying”. Thing is though, something being intentionally unsatisfying doesn’t change the fact that it was unsatisfying. I feel like they could have expressed the same theme without it feeling so half assed and unfinished. ... score: 0.22274

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally get that empty feeling you're describing! Sonny Boy is one of those shows that deliberately leaves you with more questions than answers, and I think that's intentional on Natsume's part. The ending isn't meant to provide closure in the traditional sense - it's more about the bittersweet nature of growing up and how we all eventually have to leave our "islands" behind. As for Nozomi's death, I interpreted it as her power finally consuming her completely. Throughout the series, we see hints that using abilities comes with a cost, and Nozomi had been pushing herself to her limits. Asakaze couldn't save her because by that point, she had already made her choice to sacrifice herself. His power has limitations too - he can't just reverse any death, especially when it's tied to someone's power/essence like that. The show is definitely more about the emotional journey than the mechanical explanations of how things work. ... score: 0.31369

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from. Sonny Boy is one of those shows that feels intentionally ambiguous, and the ending in particular is super open to interpretation. That empty feeling you mention is something a lot of viewers felt, myself included. It’s kind of similar to "Angel Beats" in that it’s more about the journey and the emotions rather than tying everything up in a neat bow. As for Nozomi in episode 10, it’s a bit tricky. From what I understood, her "death" wasn’t a typical physical death—it’s more like she lost her "possibility" to continue existing in that world. Asakaze couldn’t save her because, at that point, the rules of the world had shifted and his power wasn’t absolute anymore. The show plays a lot with the idea that some things are just out of your control, no matter how much power you think you have.

It’s one of those shows that doesn’t give you neat, wrapped-up answers and instead leaves a lot of things open to interpretation, which can definitely leave you feeling empty or even frustrated. The surreal vibe throughout the series builds up this strange atmosphere where reality feels fluid, and then the ending kind of doubles down on that. I think the point was more about the characters’ emotional journeys and how they cope with isolation and change rather than delivering a traditional plot resolution. As for Nozami’s “death,” I interpreted it as a metaphorical or existential kind of death rather than a physical one. Asakaze’s powers might have limits tied to emotional or mental states rather than just being able to reverse anything on command.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I just binged the entire series and I have to say, the empty feeling you're experiencing is completely normal. I felt the same way after finishing it, and I think it's because the show does a great job of making you invest in the characters and their struggles. The world they're in is so unique and fascinating, and the way the story unfolds is both captivating and unsettling at the same time. I think the reason why you're feeling empty is because the show doesn't give you a clear resolution or a traditional happy ending, which can be frustrating for some viewers. As for Nozami's "death" in episode 10, I think it's because Asakaze's power has its limitations, and it's not something that can be used to bring people back from the dead. The show does a good job of explaining the rules of the world and the characters' abilities, but sometimes it's easy to get confused. I think it's also worth noting that the show's creator, Shingo Natsume, has said in interviews that he intentionally left some things open to interpretation, so it's possible that we're not meant to fully understand everything that happens in the show. ... score: 0.29742

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I completely understand where you're coming from. "Sonny Boy" had so many layers and intricate character development, but that final episode just felt like it didn't tie everything together neatly. It's one of those endings that leaves you with more questions than answers, and it's a bit frustrating. I think the show was trying to leave things open to interpretation, but it just didn't land for me. As for Nozami's "death," it's a bit of a plot twist. Asakaze's power is limited by his own emotional state and the bonds he shares with others. In that moment, he was overwhelmed by his own grief and the weight of the situation, which might have hindered his ability to use his power effectively. It's a bit of a cop-out, but it does add to the emotional intensity of the scene. Still, it's a show that will stick with you, and I'm sure we'll be discussing it for a long time to come. ... score: 0.30118

Post: Roddick Agreeing with Opelka about doubles
So this was from the lastest podcast episode of Roddick's Served Podcast. I have to say Roddick's general attitude regarding doubles is a bit over the top. I dont know what his problem is regardless of it making money or not but he just comes off as belittling doubles players and acting like how Opelka says that they are failed singles players.

Roddick in his podcasts tends to just shit on doubles to no end. For him its just a money suck. Even with that nice feel good win of patten and heliovaara he went and shit on it. Even i the recent podcast he keeps harping on doubles being a money suck when I genuinely dont see it. He also seems to hate the fact that doubles specialists exists and also agrees with Reilly that doubles players are just failed singles players or ones who never tried at singles. (Also as aside note love how he's fine with all the shit that Reilly posts cause 'he's just being himself' but needs to find a way to critique other players who post shit on social media

Roddick in this podcast episode really has me turning off from him cause of the way he is talking. Watching it today it was just like "if you dont agree with me then your just an emotional loser who doesnt understand the realities of money and life'. But like doubles has been here for a while it makes money when the tournaments promote it properly IMO. Heliovaara and Patten winning was such a nice thing imo given the sturggle they had to make it into tennis. Maybe Roddick's been blessed in that he's never had that issue of financial struggle and its clearly showing especially wiht the Bopanna comments.

Overall very preachy and over the top.

EDIT: He's really doubling down on it with short he released pretty much saying anyone who disagrees with him is just being emotional. What i am seeing is just a retired player using a podcast as is little soapbox and not actually providing any value here. For all the facts he says he actually hasnt provided any aside from Doubles has been here for a while. He hasnt said how much the tours or slams spend to promote doubles.

Reddit author comment: None of them explained why they don’t want double specialists, just that they don’t. Apparently a player said they have no problem with Bopanna, just that they don’t want another one, why? It just screams jealousy. The singles players complain about scheduling enough, now they’re all gonna start playing doubles? Give me a break.

Something I don’t really ever see considered is the cost to go watch tennis, I was looking recently at tickets for Turin, Stuttgart and Vienna, Turin was at least €200 for half a day of the first RR, Vienna was €100 for some R1 seats and Stuttgart was about €130 for a weekend grounds pass. It’s insane, I got day 1 centre court Wimbledon tickets last year for £70, but tour events charge more, so if people are just attending one event a year that’s cost a lot they probably do want to see a big name they know and can tell people about.

The guy was an incredible singles player and I have massive respect for what he accomplished, but his takes on doubles are just straight up disrespectful. Like, does he not realize that some of the greatest tennis minds in history were doubles specialists? The Bryan Brothers revolutionized the game and brought so much excitement to doubles tennis. And the argument that they're "failed singles players" is just lazy analysis. Some players genuinely prefer the strategy and teamwork aspect of doubles - it's a completely different skill set. Roddick seems to think that because he found success in singles, that's the only "legitimate" path in tennis. It's giving major boomer energy tbh.

I get that singles is the marquee event and where the big money and attention go, but to constantly dismiss doubles as just a "money suck" seems incredibly tone-deaf. Doubles brings a different set of skills to the table—reflexes, teamwork, strategy—that singles simply doesn't highlight in the same way. And for a lot of fans, the excitement and unpredictability of doubles is a huge draw. I also think it’s unfair to call doubles players “failed singles players”; some people just excel in a different discipline, and that should be celebrated, not mocked.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I get where you’re coming from with Roddick’s attitude on doubles—it does feel unnecessarily harsh and dismissive at times. Doubles is a distinct discipline with its own strategies, skills, and fanbase, and to reduce it to just “failed singles players” is pretty disrespectful. Not every player who specializes in doubles is someone who couldn’t cut it in singles; some choose doubles because they genuinely enjoy the format or have skill sets that shine more in that environment. Plus, doubles adds a lot of excitement and variety to tournaments, and players like Heliovaara and Patten have compelling stories that inspire fans. Roddick’s approach feels like he’s using his platform to belittle rather than educate, which is disappointing. ... score: 0.35857

As someone who's been following tennis for years, I think it's unfair to belittle doubles players and view them as failed singles players. The skillset and strategy required to excel in doubles are entirely different from singles, and it's not as simple as just being a "failed" singles player. I also find it interesting that Roddick tends to focus on the financial aspect of doubles, but doesn't provide any concrete evidence or data to support his claims.

I get that he's coming from a singles player's perspective, but it's frustrating when he doesn't acknowledge the unique challenges and strategies involved in doubles.

Post: Did I see what I thought I saw on Amazon Prime?
For the first time ever, I have Amazon Prime.  I took the 30 days free in order to buy a few discounted things on the Prime Days.

So I ordered a number of things on sale and when I ordered on thing, the shipping comes up with options.  IIRC, it had like 3 options and they were all free.  One of them offered me a $1 reward if I waited about 10 days.  Then it said I would be saving boxes (or something) if I went with the 3 or 4 day option.  I went with the fastest free option.

Here's the thing that gets me, they charge you quite a bit extra to get fast shipping when you don't have Prime, but now it looks like they don't want me to take advantage of the fast shipping when I DO HAVE PRIME.

It's like they want to screw me with high shipping costs, then ask nicely if I'll just take the slower shipping for no reason other than saving them a buck.

----------

Also, the show on Prime are not all free.  I browsed around and even OLD SHOWS can costs a few buck per episode.

Gotta say that I'm a bit surprised and disappointed.

Reddit author comment: We own a business that we run from home and generally have somewhere in the ballpark of 40 packages delivered from Amazon per week. It’s actually much simpler for us to get them all on one day of the week so we can be sure someone is home and so we can dedicate part of that day to getting everything where it needs to go. 

I often choose this option for non-business items as well. Say I buy a coffee pot and filters to go with it. I can’t use one without the other, so I’ll just have them shipped on the same day, even though it’s the later date. 

Finally, ordering everything to arrive on one day *does* greatly reduce packaging, which is important if you have as many packages coming as us (we’d have to pay to have the boxes hauled away if everything came individually wrapped), or even if you’re just a bit environmentally conscious. 

Instead of being annoyed by it, consider that not everyone has the same needs as you, and choose the option that works best for you. ... score: 0.23562

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You've basically discovered Amazon's entire business model in one post! The shipping thing is absolutely by design - they want you to pay for Prime membership, then once you have it, they try to nudge you away from using the expensive fast shipping that you technically paid for. That $1 credit is their way of saying "please don't cost us money on shipping." It's pretty brilliant from a business perspective but feels scammy as a customer. The box consolidation thing is their environmental guilt-trip angle, but really it's about reducing their logistics costs. As for Prime Video, yeah, it's basically a loss leader to get you hooked on the ecosystem. The "free" content is mostly older stuff or their originals, while anything remotely current or popular costs extra. You're paying for the privilege of having access to their storefront, not actually getting everything included.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Yeah, you saw it right. Amazon has been doing this for a while now. When you have Prime, you get the “free” fast shipping, but they also offer the option to delay your shipment in exchange for a small digital credit (usually $1), which you can use for things like Kindle books or digital videos. What they’re really doing is incentivizing you to help them consolidate shipments and reduce their shipping costs. It’s a win-win for them: if you take the credit, they save on logistics; if you go for fast shipping, you feel like you’re getting your money’s worth from Prime. The thing about not all shows being free is also true. Prime Video comes with a rotating selection of free content, but a ton of stuff—even old series—require you to pay extra, which can definitely feel like a rip-off when you’re paying for Prime.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Yeah, I noticed that too when I first got Prime. The whole “free shipping” thing is a bit misleading sometimes because it really depends on the seller and the item. Amazon tries to push you toward slower shipping options to save on costs and reduce packaging waste, but it definitely feels like they’re nudging you to wait longer even though you paid for Prime. The $1 reward for waiting is a weird little incentive, but honestly, I’d rather just get my stuff quickly without having to think about it. As for the shows, Prime Video is a mixed bag. Some content is free with Prime, but a lot of the newer or popular stuff is actually rentals or purchases. It’s a bummer when you expect everything to be included. ... score: 0.19739

It's almost as if they're trying to balance their own costs with the benefits they offer to Prime members. I've also noticed that the selection of free shows and movies on Prime Video is not as extensive as I thought it would be.

Post: What happens if/when Intel spins off foundry?
Is it sure it’s going to happen?

And what does it mean if you own Intel stock?  Is it that the company will sell it for like $50BN then just have $50BN cash on hand?  And now I just don’t have a share in the foundry business anymore?

Reddit author comment: It is not certain it is going to happen, it's all just rumors of talks. Even if the rumors are true, talks do not always result in deals. 

Anyway, there are multiple ways to do a spinoff. 

It *might* just be sold and cash added to the business, as you suggest. Or, it might be made into a separate publicly traded company and a 'special dividend' issued to give you shares in that company. Or, it might be made into a separate company but still owned by the parent company, in which case your ownership of the spinoff is indirect. 

Whichever of these paths is taken, if rumors are to believed, it will be further complicated by being a joint venture: meaning other parties will contribute cash, personnel, IP, or other value to the new company in exchange for partial ownership. 

In any case, you'll know a lot more detail well ahead of time, if there's a spinoff there will be a shareholder vote to approve the deal. ... score: 0.23304

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: It's not a sure thing yet, but it's looking increasingly likely given Intel's financial pressures and the foundry division's struggles to compete with TSMC. If Intel does spin off the foundry business, here's what would likely happen to your stock: You'd typically receive shares in the new foundry company proportional to your Intel holdings, plus keep your existing Intel shares (which would now be for a smaller, more focused company). Think of it like when PayPal spun off from eBay - shareholders got both eBay and PayPal stock. The $50B wouldn't just sit as cash; it would probably be used to pay down Intel's massive debt, fund R&D for their core CPU business, or be returned to shareholders through dividends/buybacks. The real question is whether a standalone foundry can actually compete without Intel's backing, since they're already years behind TSMC in advanced node technology. Your total investment value might actually increase if the market values the separated companies higher than the combined entity. ... score: 0.25116

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Not guaranteed yet, but there are a lot of rumors and some hints from Intel management that spinning off the foundry business is on the table. If it happens, it’ll probably be structured as either a full spin-off (where Intel shareholders get shares in the new foundry entity) or a partial sale/IPO (where Intel sells a stake in the foundry to outside investors while retaining some ownership). If it’s a straight sale, then yeah, Intel would get a big cash infusion, but they’d lose that part of the business — so future profits from the foundry would go to the buyer, not Intel shareholders. If you’re holding Intel stock, your exposure to the foundry’s future would depend on how the deal is structured. Sometimes, shareholders get a “dividend” in the form of shares in the spun-off company, but not always. Also, selling the foundry could mean Intel is more “pure play” on design and less on manufacturing, which could be good or bad depending on how you see their prospects. It’s a big move, so it would definitely affect the stock, but the exact impact depends on the details. ... score: 0.29561

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: From what I understand, Intel has been considering spinning off its foundry business as a way to unlock value and focus more on its core CPU and chip design operations. It’s not 100% guaranteed, but insiders and analysts have been talking about it for a while, so it feels increasingly likely. If the spin-off happens, Intel might create a separate publicly traded company for the foundry segment, or possibly sell it outright to another player, which could indeed bring in a large influx of cash, potentially around the $50 billion mark you mentioned. For existing Intel shareholders, this means your shares would represent ownership in the “new” Intel without the foundry operations. You might receive shares in the new foundry entity as part of the spin-off, or there could be a special dividend payout. Either way, the foundry business would no longer be part of Intel’s core operations, which might affect growth prospects and valuation differently. It’s a bit of a double-edged sword: you lose direct exposure to the foundry growth story, but Intel’s remaining business might become more focused and efficient.

While it's true that nothing is set in stone yet, the rumors and reports suggest that it's a possibility that Intel is seriously considering. If the spin-off were to happen, it would likely have significant implications for the company's financials and stock price. In terms of what it means for shareholders like myself, it's possible that the foundry business could be sold for a substantial amount, potentially in the range of $50 billion or more, as you mentioned. This would indeed leave Intel with a large amount of cash on hand, which could be used to invest in other areas of the business, pay off debt, or even distribute to shareholders in the form of dividends. However, as a shareholder, I would no longer have a direct stake in the foundry business, which could be a significant loss if the business continues to grow and thrive. On the other hand, the spin-off could also allow Intel to focus more on its core businesses, such as CPU manufacturing, and potentially lead to increased efficiency and profitability. Overall, it's a complex situation, and I'll be keeping a close eye on any developments to see how it might impact my investment. ... score: 0.3422

If this does happen, it would likely be structured as a spin-off or a sale, and the exact financial details would depend on the chosen route. If it's a spin-off, current Intel shareholders would receive shares in the new company, which would maintain your ownership interest, but in a separate entity. The primary motivation for this could be to unlock the value in the foundry business, which is seen as a high-growth area, and to allow Intel to focus on its core CPU business. The new company could be more agile and attract investment more easily. If it's a sale, Intel would indeed receive a significant amount of cash, which could be used to pay down debt, invest in R&D, or return capital to shareholders through buybacks or dividends.

Post: What do I do if my boyfriend is putting our hamster in dangerous situations?
My boyfriend keeps leaving the hamster enclosure open, our hamster likes to escape and can and he leaves it open often. This week he is at his parents house and he has a vicious untrained dog in his house. He often lets this dog into his room with the hamster there. The dog isn’t in direct reach of the hamster but if she tried harder she could definitely knock his enclosure down and eat him. He doesn’t think it’s a big deal but he won’t listen to me about not letting his dog in and I can’t do anything about it because he is 8 hours away from me.

Your boyfriend is being incredibly irresponsible and frankly cruel to put a small, defenseless animal in repeated danger like this. Hamsters are prey animals and even just the presence of a predator like an untrained dog causes them extreme stress, not to mention the very real physical danger of the enclosure being knocked over or the dog getting access to the hamster.

I would honestly consider retrieving the hamster as soon as possible - this isn't about being controlling, it's about protecting a vulnerable animal that depends on you both for safety. If he can't be trusted to provide basic safety measures like keeping the enclosure secure and away from predators, then he shouldn't have custody of the pet.

Post: Memory loss
Anyone else in here at can’t remember shit? I can’t remember short term or long term. Sometimes things will come to me days after. Sometimes it’s literally years before a random memory pops up. Not all trauma memories just simple stuff too. I also have ADHD but all my psychiatrist try to give me anti depressants. I’m not depressed I just got chronic ptsd and my memory is funky. 

Reddit author comment: For sure. My focus and short term memory are not great. Part of it is that I have a very busy life, I have 2 young kids etc etc. I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD and am primarily inattentive type (more classically thought of as ADD), and treating that has made a difference in my focus which I find helps me remember better, but I completely understand where you are coming from.

In terms of the antidepressant that your psychiatrist may have recommended it may have been for a few other reasons than them simply thinking you are depressed. Some of those medications help to reduce or regulate cortisol (the stress hormone) release that is associated with PTSD. ADHD also fucks up the release or transfer of dopamine to certain parts of your brain which can leave people feeling depressed . I AM NOT medically trained and I don't know almost anything about the technical side of medications.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Holy shit, yes! I thought I was losing my mind until I started researching the connection between PTSD and memory issues. It's actually super common - trauma literally rewires how our brains store and retrieve memories. The hippocampus (which handles memory formation) gets all messed up when we're in chronic fight-or-flight mode. I have the same thing where I'll randomly remember something from like 5 years ago while I can't remember what I had for breakfast.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, you’re not alone. Memory issues can be a huge part of both ADHD and CPTSD, and it’s super frustrating when people (especially professionals) brush it off or try to treat it as depression. I relate a lot to what you’re saying—sometimes I’ll forget what I did yesterday, or I’ll be in a conversation and suddenly a random memory from years ago will hit me out of nowhere. It’s not that I’m not paying attention, it’s just like my brain is on a delay or has huge gaps. I read somewhere that the stress from PTSD can impact how your brain stores and retrieves memories, and ADHD makes it even harder to keep things in the short-term “working memory.” It sucks that psychiatrists just want to throw antidepressants at you instead of actually addressing what you’re describing.

It’s really common for people with chronic PTSD to experience memory disruptions, not just with traumatic events but with everyday stuff too. The brain sometimes prioritizes or suppresses certain memories as a coping mechanism, which can make it feel like you’re losing chunks of time or details. It sucks that your psychiatrists keep pushing antidepressants when you don’t feel depressed—sometimes it takes finding someone who specializes in trauma or ADHD to get a treatment plan that addresses your specific struggles, like therapy focused on trauma processing or even ADHD coaching.

Post: Why do I get sick here so easily?
I’ve always gotten sick more often here than anywhere else!! Also it comes on super fast and SUPER hard, I get things like body aches and weakness that I never get anywhere else 🥲 for context I grew up in south Florida for 18 years, but I’ve lived here for 4 years now so I thought I would get used to new germs.. also I do take vitamin supplements so (?) not sure why it keeps happening 😭 anyone else feel this? 

Reddit author comment: If it makes you feel better, I also moved here from Florida at about the same time (about a year earlier give or take) and I’m probably about the same amount of sick as I was then, or maybe a little less. I hang out in large groups and go to concerts less often than I did in FL. But, the past year as my kid has entered into school, I’ve been getting way more sick. 

So, it’s likely because you’re in college now as the main culprit. Drinking (if you are), lack of sleep, weakened immune system from COVID, as others have mentioned, are going to play a factor, too. But, at the end of the day, if you are constantly exposed to more illnesses than you were before, you’re going to get sick more often.

It is worth noting that winter illnesses are more rampant in a climate with an actual winter. I got sick in Florida plenty, but winter definitely hits harder here. ... score: 0.2377

Back home in California I maybe got sick once a year, but here it feels like I'm constantly fighting something off. The worst part is exactly what you described - it hits like a freight train out of nowhere. I'll wake up feeling fine and by noon I'm practically bedridden with the most intense body aches and fatigue. I've talked to my doctor about it and they mentioned that different regions can have different viral strains that your immune system isn't familiar with, plus environmental factors like humidity, air quality, and even altitude can play a role. Have you noticed if it happens more during certain seasons? For me it seems worse during the transition periods between seasons.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally relate to what you’re describing! I moved from the southwest to the Midwest, and for the first few years, it felt like my immune system just couldn’t keep up. I think part of it is the difference in climate—humidity, temperature swings, and even air quality can all impact how your body reacts to viruses and bacteria. Also, places with colder winters mean people spend more time indoors, which can make germs spread more easily. Even if you take vitamins, stress, sleep, and other lifestyle changes (like new allergens) can play a huge role, too. It took me a while to adjust, but I still get random bouts of sickness that hit harder than I remember. You’re definitely not alone! ... score: 0.25334

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Oh man, I totally get where you’re coming from! Moving to a new place can really mess with your immune system, especially if the climate, allergens, or local microbes are different from what your body’s used to. South Florida has a pretty unique environment—hot, humid, and with a specific set of seasonal illnesses—so your immune system might still be reacting strongly to new germs or allergens where you are now. Also, sometimes vitamin supplements help, but they’re not a magic fix for adapting to a new ecosystem. Have you tried seeing a local doctor to check for things like mold allergies or chronic sinus issues? Sometimes those can make you feel extra sick and weak. It might also help to slowly build up your exposure to local allergens in a controlled way or get tested for any sensitivities. Hang in there!

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who has also experienced a similar phenomenon, I've come to the realization that it's not just about the new germs, but also about the overall environment and lifestyle. For instance, the air quality, water quality, and even the type of food we consume can have a significant impact on our immune system. In my case, I've noticed that I get sick more often during the winter months when the air is drier and the sun is scarce, which can weaken my immune system. Additionally, I've found that my diet plays a crucial role in my overall health, and consuming foods high in sugar and processed ingredients can make me more susceptible to illnesses. Therefore, I would recommend exploring these factors and making adjustments to your lifestyle to see if it makes a difference.

Post: [TENANT] Property Inspections
I've been renting a close to 4,000 square foot house in an upscale neighborhood in Southern Arizona for almost 4 years.  The property has been managed by the same property management company for the whole time.  In the annual lease, there is a clause that the home is to be inspected every 90 days.  They send a letter every 90 days giving me about 5 days notice as to when the inspector will be there.


I received a letter from them today saying that the inspector will be there this coming Monday.  I called them and asked to reschedule until after the holidays as this is a really hectic time for our family.  We have a couple of parties planned, one for clients -- one for friends, the house is in minor chaos mode with presents being wrapped, etc., etc., you get the picture.  If the inspection was just a quick glance around it would be one thing, but this guy spends almost an hour there, checking HVAC filters, poking his head in closets, going in/out of every room in the house, checking the bathrooms, looking in the oven -- it drives me nuts.


They were completely uncooperative about rescheduling saying they had a lot of properties to inspect and didn't schedule any the week between Christmas and New Year's and we couldn't change the date.  I also asked them if they could change the frequency of the inspections to semi-annually rather than quarterly and they said they couldn't unless the landlord initiated the request, they wouldn't go to him to ask.


I can understand if I were a bad tenant, was late paying the rent, made a lot of requests for repairs, damaged the place, etc.  I haven't had one single issue since moving in.  I only repair I have had them fix was when a control unit went out on the double oven.  I have the carpets cleaned twice a year at my expense.


I have the telephone number and address of the actual owner of the property.  Do you 1) think I'm being reasonable to ask for a reduction in the number of inspections?, and 2) if the management company isn't interested in contacting the landlord of my behalf, do you think it is reasonable to contact the landlord directly?

Reddit author comment: Don't worry about contacting the owner. I've had some bad experiences with property management companies and have always been able to resolve issues with the owner directly. I would send the owner a letter stating how you always cooperate and change your schedule for these frequent inspections but the one time you requested it during this hectic time the property management company refused. Because of this, you are requesting the inspections be less frequent so this problem will be avoided in the future. I think it would help if you were able to find out how often HVAC filters and whatever else the guy looks at need inspected/replaced. I've never heard of 90 day inspections, it seems like maybe the management company is getting something out of it. In any case, I've never had an issue that wasn't resolved by a polite letter to the owner. If it doesn't get changed then definitely use your next renewal as leverage when it comes time. ... score: 0.26722

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're absolutely being reasonable here! Quarterly inspections for a 4-year tenant with a spotless record is honestly excessive, especially for such thorough hour-long inspections. Most landlords do annual inspections at most, and some only inspect when there's a specific concern or between tenants. The fact that you've had zero issues, pay on time, and even go above and beyond with carpet cleaning at your own expense shows you're an ideal tenant. The property management company is being unnecessarily rigid - good property managers work with reliable tenants, not against them. I'd definitely contact the landlord directly. You're not going behind anyone's back since the management company explicitly said they won't advocate for you. Frame it positively when you call - mention how much you love the property, your track record as a tenant, and that you'd like to discuss potentially reducing inspection frequency to semi-annual given your history. Most reasonable landlords would be happy to accommodate a proven tenant, especially one who's been there 4 years. The worst they can say is no, but there's a good chance they'll be more flexible than their management company. ... score: 0.35777

You have every right to advocate for yourself, and I don’t see anything wrong with politely reaching out to the landlord.

Quarterly inspections might make sense for problem tenants, but for someone like you, semi-annual or even annual inspections should suffice.

The fact that the management company is unwilling to work with you to reschedule the inspection or even consider changing the frequency of the inspections is quite inflexible.

However, given the circumstances, I believe it's reasonable to reach out to the landlord, especially since you've already established a good relationship with the property. It's possible that the landlord is not aware of the management company's strict policies, and by contacting them directly, you may be able to find a more mutually beneficial solution.

Post: I hate it when Used products cost as much as the New ones
Trying to be more mindful of where my dollar goes for environmental/political reasons. My order of operation of consuming goes in: 

1. Do you actually need it?

2. Can you get it local? (More time consuming than buying online. Also no guarantee that local business will actually have that product when I get there like the Big Box stores)

3. Can you get it used? 

4. If not, buy new. 

  
I've been trying to buy more used products but found that I am spending just as much than buying brand new product with no wear and tear and with warranties. 

This applies to most products I actually need to buy. Coffee dripper, clothes, cars, furniture, cookwares. It doesn't matter if I'm looking at eBay, thrift stores, or Facebook Marketplace. 

It's just very frustrating that I need to spend more time and effort making sure the used products don't have as bad of wear and tear while also paying almost the same price, or even more than buying new. 

I am a normal person with busy jobs and responsibilities. I do not have all the time and money in the world. It saddens me that too often, getting used products is not worth it. 

What are some tips to help spending more mindfully while realistically acknowledging the time, effort, and cost it takes to continue this kind of lifestyle?

My friend went with a friend from college. She is plus sized. One of the workers walked up to her and said in a mean girl voice that they won't have anything in her size. 

In some places thrift stores are marking up their prices because people are buying a massive amount of clothes. Sometimes Walmart is cheaper. It's a very weird form of over consumption. You should buy what you need and not a whole new wardrobe every month.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, this is such a relatable struggle! I've tried SO many different methods over the years. What absolutely didn't work for me was stacking containers inside each other without any system - it created this nightmare avalanche situation where I'd have to pull out 15 containers just to find the right size, and then the lids would be scattered everywhere. I also tried those fancy drawer dividers, but they were too rigid and couldn't accommodate different container shapes. What finally worked was dedicating one deep drawer to containers and storing them upright like files, with lids stored separately in a shallow basket on top. I can see everything at a glance, grab what I need without disturbing others, and the lids are easily accessible. My biggest tip is to ruthlessly declutter - throw away any containers without matching lids, and donate extras.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: One thing that has really worked for me is dedicating a specific deep drawer just for plastic food containers and their lids. I used to keep everything in a cupboard, but the containers would constantly avalanche out or get lost in the back. Now, I nest the same-sized containers together and use a large, shallow basket just for the lids, sorted by size and shape. The biggest change was making a rule that I never put a container away unless its matching lid is present. This way, I never end up with a bunch of lidless containers or vice versa.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I used to just stack all my plastic containers in one big pile, which quickly became a nightmare because lids would get lost or mismatched, and it was impossible to find the right size when I needed it. That method definitely did not work for me. What finally helped was using a dedicated drawer organizer with adjustable dividers. I separate lids and containers, stacking containers by size nested inside each other and then placing the lids vertically in a separate section. This keeps everything visible and easy to access, plus it prevents the lids from getting damaged. My biggest tip is to always keep lids and containers paired as much as possible, and if you don’t have a matching lid, consider donating or recycling that container to reduce clutter. Also, labeling shelves or sections can speed up clean-up and keep the system consistent for everyone in the household. ... score: 0.37533

Post: I received a fully cooked ham as a gift and I don't know what to do
I've never had a holiday ham before. It's only two of us, so I'm not sure if I just slice off what we want to eat in a night and heat that up or do I have to heat the whole thing up first before slicing it? There are no instructions on the ham besides that it's fully cooked and ready to eat, hot or cold? It comes with a honey glaze. Any advice would be appreciated!

Reddit author comment: You can eat it cold or hot.

The idea with the glaze is if you wanna do a big center piece you reheat it in the oven with the glaze on it.

You can do that if you want then use the leftovers the same way as any other meat. Or if you don't care about the glaze and big center piece on the table you can just slice portions cold and eat them how you like.

My market usually has hams on deep discount during the holidays, and even though they're mediocre quality I'll get one just to slice off portions for sandwiches and stuff straight from the fridge. My family always did this growing up because during the holidays there's a ton going on and my mom wouldn't always have time to make meals. ... score: 0.24394

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Congrats on your first holiday ham! You're actually in a great position since it's fully cooked - this makes everything so much easier. You absolutely do NOT need to heat the whole thing up first. What I always do is slice off just what I need for that meal (aim for about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick slices), then gently warm those portions in a skillet with a little butter or in the microwave for 30-60 seconds. The ham is perfectly safe to eat cold too, so don't stress about it. For the honey glaze, you can brush it on the slices before warming them up, or even just drizzle it over after heating. Store the rest of the ham wrapped tightly in the fridge - it'll keep for about a week. Pro tip: save the ham bone if there is one, it makes incredible soup! Ham sandwiches with the leftovers are also amazing. You're going to love it, ham is such a treat and way more forgiving than people think. ... score: 0.31533

You can absolutely just slice off what you want to eat and heat those slices up (in a pan, oven, or even microwave), or you can eat it cold if that’s your thing. If you want the classic “holiday ham” experience, though, I’d recommend glazing and heating the whole ham in the oven (covered with foil at first, then uncovered for a nice caramelized finish) and then slicing off pieces as you go. The leftovers can be used in sandwiches, omelets, soups, or even diced into salads. Hams keep really well in the fridge for several days, and you can freeze leftover slices too.

To answer your question directly, you don't necessarily have to heat the whole thing up first before slicing it, as it's fully cooked and ready to eat, hot or cold. However, if you prefer it warm, you can definitely slice off what you want to eat for the night and heat it up in the oven or microwave. The honey glaze that comes with it is probably intended to be served as is, or you can choose to heat it up alongside the ham if you prefer it warm and caramelized.

For a warm serving, you can slice off what you need and heat it up in the oven or microwave. I usually slice about a quarter-inch thick and heat it in the oven at 325°F for about 10-15 minutes, just until it’s warmed through. The honey glaze is a game-changer! I like to brush it on the ham slices before heating to get that nice, sweet, caramelized flavor. If you have leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the fridge for a few days.

So really Sept is the last month to really change minds.

i don't think it's over stating things to say that if Republicans get any part of Congress it will signal the beginning of the end for America as we know it.

The democrats need to fire every bullet in their chamber on this one. They need a homerun finish on Jan6th hearings. Biden needs to get the student loan debt relief through. candidates like Beto and Hobbs need to win. Warnock and Fetterman need to do more than just scrape by, both of their opponents are complete clowns.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Really interesting night watching these results come in! The New Hampshire GOP Senate primary between Bolduc and Morse was way closer than I expected - Bolduc's Trump endorsement really seemed to push him over the edge in the final weeks. What's fascinating is how this sets up the general election against Hassan. Bolduc is definitely more of a wildcard candidate compared to Morse who had more establishment backing. Democrats are probably feeling pretty good about this outcome since Bolduc's election denial stance and some of his more controversial positions might play poorly with independents in a purple state like New Hampshire. Meanwhile, the Rhode Island gubernatorial race on the Democratic side was a nail-biter too. McKee managing to hold on as the incumbent governor despite some serious challenges shows that incumbency still matters, even when you're dealing with ethics questions.

However, for smaller dramas, comedies, or dialogue-heavy films, regular screens are perfectly fine and you're not missing much. As for glasses, you don't need special glasses for regular IMAX - only for IMAX 3D showings. Regular IMAX is just a bigger screen with better audio. For Mickey 17, since it's a Bong Joon-ho sci-fi film, I'd say it could be worth the IMAX experience depending on how visually ambitious it is.

They trained it for just $5.6 million, chump change compared to the Billions companies like OpenAI and Google throw around, and are asking the US government for Billions more. The silicon valley AI companies have been saying that there's no way to train AI cheaper, and that what they need is more power.

DeepSeek pulled it off by optimizing hardware and letting the model basically teach itself. There are some companies that have heavily invested in using AI that are now really rethinking about which model they'll be using.

The big story here is that this Chinese AI lab claims to have achieved GPT-4 level performance while spending only a fraction of what OpenAI, Google, and others have invested. We're talking millions vs billions in training costs. If true, this completely disrupts the narrative that you need massive capital expenditure and thousands of high-end GPUs to compete in AI. The market is freaking out because companies like Nvidia have been riding the AI gold rush, selling chips at premium prices under the assumption that AI development requires enormous computational resources. DeepSeek's approach suggests there might be more efficient ways to train these models, which could reduce demand for expensive hardware.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've dealt with this exact same issue for years! Downhill hiking puts way more stress on your knees than uphill - you're essentially doing controlled falls with each step and your quads have to work overtime to absorb that impact. A few things that have really helped me: First, invest in trekking poles if you don't already have them - they're absolute game changers for taking pressure off your knees on descents. Second, focus on your technique - take shorter steps, land on your midfoot rather than heel striking, and try to keep your knees slightly bent to act as shock absorbers. Third, strengthen your quads and glutes at home with exercises like squats, lunges, and step-downs. The stronger these muscles are, the better they can support your knees during long descents. Also consider the terrain - sometimes taking a slightly longer but less steep route down can save your knees a lot of pain. I used to push through the pain thinking it would get better, but addressing it proactively made such a huge difference in my hiking enjoyment. ... score: 0.34055

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey, I’ve dealt with the same thing and it’s pretty common among hikers, especially on longer descents. A lot of knee pain going downhill comes from the increased impact and the way your knees have to stabilize your body as you step down. Some things that have helped me: First, using trekking poles really helps take some of the load off your knees. Second, focus on strengthening your quads, hamstrings, and glutes—stronger muscles help absorb the shock. Also, try to shorten your stride and keep your knees slightly bent instead of locking them out with each step. Finally, consider good quality hiking boots with proper cushioning and maybe even knee braces if you’re prone to pain. If it keeps happening, though, it might be worth seeing a PT to rule out anything more serious. Good luck! ... score: 0.35099

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey, I’ve definitely experienced the same issue with knee pain during long descents after significant elevation gain. It often comes down to the added stress on your knees when you’re hiking downhill, especially over long distances. One thing that helped me was investing in trekking poles—they really take a lot of pressure off your knees by distributing some of the impact to your arms. Also, focusing on strengthening your quads and hamstrings through exercises like squats and lunges can improve knee stability. Lastly, consider your hiking shoes; make sure they have good cushioning and support. Sometimes, custom orthotics help too. If the pain persists, it might be worth seeing a physical therapist to rule out any underlying issues like patellar tendinitis or IT band syndrome. Hope this helps! ... score: 0.37321

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a seasoned hiker, I've experienced similar issues with knee pain when hiking downhill, especially on long and strenuous trails. One thing that has helped me is to focus on my footing and try to roll my feet from heel to toe, rather than landing heavily on my heels. This helps to reduce the impact on my knees and can make a big difference. I've also found that using trekking poles can be incredibly helpful, as they allow me to take some of the weight off my knees and distribute it more evenly. Additionally, I make sure to stretch regularly, both before and after my hikes, to keep my muscles loose and flexible. I've also started incorporating strength training into my routine, focusing on exercises that target my core and leg muscles, which has helped to improve my overall stability and reduce my knee pain. I hope these suggestions are helpful, and I'd love to hear about any other strategies that have worked for you. It's also worth considering the type of hiking boots or shoes you're wearing, as well as the condition of the trails you're hiking on, as these can also play a role in knee pain. ... score: 0.42863

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: I've had similar issues before. One thing that has really helped me is to strengthen my quads. Stronger quadriceps can help take the pressure off your knees when you're going downhill. There are plenty of exercises you can do, like squats, lunges, and leg presses. Also, consider using trekking poles for extra support and to distribute the weight more evenly. Good luck! ... score: 0.37811

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I have the same issue! I find that using trekking poles really helps to take some of the pressure off my knees when descending. Also, focusing on my form has made a big difference. I try to keep my knees slightly bent and take shorter, more controlled steps. I've also started doing some specific exercises to strengthen my quads and glutes, which has helped a lot. One thing that has worked for me is the step-down exercise: stand on a small step or platform and slowly lower one foot to the ground, then return it to the step. Repeat this a few times and switch legs. It’s a great way to build the muscles that support your knees during descents. ... score: 0.4149
