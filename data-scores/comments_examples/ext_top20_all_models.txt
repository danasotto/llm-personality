Post: What’s a good 1.5 Weeks New England itinerary for the summer?
As the title states, I am looking for some itinerary/ ideas for visiting New England for a week and a half in the summer. 

I’m looking to site see, go on hikes/ enjoy outdoors, and eat good food. 

I know I won’t be able to see all 6 states but I would like to see Massachusetts, Rhode Island, andd I’m not sure what else I should try to fit -  open to many ideas :) 

Reddit author comment: Here’s what we did a few years ago and enjoyed it- it was a bit rushed so hopefully with your week and a half yours might not need to be so rushed.

Day 1-2 Portland, ME. Highlights were stopping in Kennebunkport for lunch, Cape Elizabeth, sunset lighthouse boat tour, Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens, LL Bean store, Fore Street restaurant.

Day 3-5 Boston, MA. Did most of the standard tourist things- Freedom trail, Red Sox game, Harvard tour, etc.

Days 5-7 Cape Cod, MA (Falmouth). We loved the shining sea bike trail and checking out the beaches, wineries, and restaurants in the area. 

Would highly recommend including Maine on your trip if you can- it was our favorite! I wish we had been able to go to Bar Harbor & Acadia National Park but it wasn’t in the cards for us that trip! ... score: 0.68848

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: **u/NewEnglandNomad**: Oh man, you're in for a treat! For 1.5 weeks, I'd definitely suggest starting in Boston for 2-3 days to hit the Freedom Trail, North End for amazing Italian food, and maybe catch a Red Sox game at Fenway. From there, head up to New Hampshire's White Mountains - the hiking there is absolutely incredible, especially Mount Washington if you're up for a challenge, or the easier Diana's Baths waterfall hike. Spend 2-3 days there, then work your way down through Vermont (Burlington is charming and has great breweries) and into the Berkshires in western Mass for some beautiful mountain scenery. End with Rhode Island - Newport's mansions are gorgeous and the Cliff Walk is perfect for photos. Don't miss the clam chowder in Boston, lobster rolls literally anywhere in Maine if you venture that far north, and Vermont cheddar cheese. The summer weather will be perfect for all the outdoor activities you're planning! ... score: 0.64524

I’d suggest starting in Boston—spend at least 2–3 days there to soak in the Freedom Trail, North End (for great Italian food), and maybe take a day trip to Salem or Cambridge. Next, head south to Rhode Island. Newport is a must: tour the Gilded Age mansions, walk the Cliff Walk, and enjoy seafood by the water. After that, consider heading to western Massachusetts—Berkshires for hiking (like Mount Greylock) and artsy towns (Lenox, Stockbridge). If you want more nature, tack on a couple days in Vermont’s Green Mountains or New Hampshire’s White Mountains for gorgeous trails and charming small towns.

Then head south to Newport, Rhode Island, for stunning coastal mansions, waterfront dining, and some beautiful beach walks. After that, drive up to the White Mountains in New Hampshire for incredible hiking trails like Franconia Notch or Mount Monadnock, where the views are unbeatable.

Post: Is it worth reviving old projects?
Years ago, I built a Microsoft Paint clone using plain JavaScript and CSS. It was a fun little project, especially for nostalgia sake. But looking back, the code is a real mess, and it lacks modern features.

Now, I’m thinking of reviving it with better technologies (React, TypeScript...) and making it useful.  
l. Maybe even turning it into a web-based alternative to Paint.NET.

Do you think it’s worth the effort?

PS: here is the project [Link](https://github.com/salahkai/MS-PAINT/) if you're interested.

Reddit author comment: Programmer here. Yes, 100% worth it.

Don't even think about it as a "revival"... it's a re-write and a whole new edition (not just new version).

When I'm learning a new technology/language/framework I nearly always start by making a simple project that I've made before, only now using the new technology. It makes it so much easier to learn a new thing/tool/tech when you are 100% familiar with the project itself.

It also makes it easier to recognize how the new thing is different. You might find that the new technology now automates something you used to do manually every single time. You might not even notice that feature in the new tech, until you're actively building something.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely worth it! I went through something similar with an old Node.js project I built in college. The original code was embarrassing - no error handling, inconsistent naming, the works. But reviving it taught me more about software architecture than any tutorial ever could. You get to see firsthand how your skills have evolved, and you already have a working prototype to build from. The fact that you're considering React and TypeScript shows you're thinking about scalability and maintainability, which is exactly what the original probably lacked. Plus, the web-based Paint.NET alternative space isn't that crowded - there's definitely room for a well-executed project. I'd suggest starting small though. Maybe pick one core feature to modernize first (like the brush system or layer management) rather than rewriting everything at once.

Your old MS Paint clone is a perfect candidate—graphics editors are a classic way to level up your skills in UI/UX, state management, and canvas manipulation. Rebuilding it with React and TypeScript will not only modernize your codebase but also make it more maintainable and potentially easier for others to contribute to. Plus, web-based alternatives to Paint.NET are surprisingly rare; a lightweight, easy-to-use online paint tool could fill a real niche.

Post: I’ve still never seen an imax or 3d movie.
The price of tickets is usually like 25-35% higher, and there's more people generally than the standard "laser" at amc. 
Am I missing a lot? Would you say it's only more important for big action movies, stuff like Jurassic park, dune, avatar, etc? Or is any movie better in imax?

Also, do I need special glasses for imax movies?
Should I see Mickey 17 in imax?


Reddit author comment: If you’re going to AMC, and you’re interested in IMAX films, I’d say it’s worth it to get the AMC A-List. Depending on area, it’s really only like 23, 24 bucks (maybe a couple more). But it lets you see up to 3 movies a week and it includes premium formats like IMAX, 3D, or Dolby for no extra cost.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're definitely missing out, but it really depends on the type of movie! IMAX is absolutely worth it for visually spectacular films like the ones you mentioned - Dune, Avatar, big sci-fi epics, Marvel movies, etc. The screen is massive and the sound system is incredible, so you feel completely immersed. However, for smaller dramas, comedies, or dialogue-heavy films, regular screens are perfectly fine and you're not missing much. As for glasses, you don't need special glasses for regular IMAX - only for IMAX 3D showings. Regular IMAX is just a bigger screen with better audio. For Mickey 17, since it's a Bong Joon-ho sci-fi film, I'd say it could be worth the IMAX experience depending on how visually ambitious it is. My advice: try IMAX once with a big blockbuster that was filmed specifically for IMAX cameras (like recent Christopher Nolan films), and you'll immediately understand whether the premium is worth it for you personally. ... score: 0.63707

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Honestly, I think IMAX and 3D are best reserved for movies that are specifically filmed or formatted for those experiences. For example, when I saw "Avatar: The Way of Water" in IMAX 3D, it was absolutely stunning and worth every extra penny—James Cameron really knows how to use the technology. But for most dramas or comedies, I don't think the extra cost or the larger crowd makes much difference. Also, not all IMAX screens are created equal; some are just bigger regular screens, so it depends on your local theater. As for glasses, you only need them for 3D showings, not regular IMAX.

If you’re watching something like Jurassic Park, Dune, or Avatar, the immersive visuals and sound really add to the experience and make it feel more epic. For smaller or dialogue-heavy films, the difference might not be worth the extra cost. Plus, the theaters tend to be more crowded during IMAX/3D showings, which can be a downside if you prefer a quieter environment. And yes, for 3D movies you definitely need those special glasses, but for IMAX, it depends—some IMAX screenings are just giant screens with enhanced sound and don’t require glasses unless it’s also 3D. Mickey 17 might be a good candidate if it has a lot of visual effects or expansive scenes, but double-check if it’s being shown in IMAX or 3D at your local theater before buying tickets. ... score: 0.55236

The ones that really benefit from the format are the ones with a lot of visual effects, like superhero movies or sci-fi epics. However, I think it's also worth noting that some movies are specifically designed to be seen in IMAX, like Christopher Nolan's films, which are often shot using IMAX cameras. These movies are optimized for the IMAX format and really take advantage of the larger screen and higher resolution. As for whether you need special glasses for IMAX movies, the answer is no. IMAX uses a different projection system that doesn't require glasses, unlike 3D movies. So, if you're considering seeing Mickey 17 in IMAX, I'd say go for it if you're a fan of the author or the genre, but if you're on a budget, the standard laser format will still be a great way to experience the movie. ... score: 0.63209

I went frustrated so quick that I've lost my camera few months ago but still unable to bring everything together and start again so 
I'm currently thinking of to start a post production agency as I'm good at editing reels for YouTubers.
I've some very good editors in my team but unable to get more clients.
No I need help to start and should I do it or not?

Reddit author comment: First of all, you really don't sound confident/professional at all (no offense). If you have to ask questions like this without even knowing the current situation of the market you are trying to get in to... your business is going to fail miserably.

Do you even have a clue on how to run a business? Do you know how to be an online marketing guru? Do you realize you will be competing against people from third-world countries spewing out twice as much edits for 1/10th of the price? Do you realize you'll soon be competing against AI? How are you going to run a post-processing agency in this market?

So no, don't start an 'agency'. You won't be able to compete. You might get some pocket money here and there though.

The demand for video editing is absolutely exploding right now with everyone trying to create content for social media. Here's my take: if you're genuinely good at editing and have a solid team, you should definitely go for it.

Post: Can Arnis / Eskrima techniques be applied using forearms?
Would it be viable to adapt arnis/eskrima techniques to strike with the forearms (provided they are conditioned) instead of using a stick or knife? By viable I mean in empty hand combat. If it is viable, what martial arts should I learn along with that to supplement?

Reddit author comment: Why reinvent the wheel? There is going to be a variety of crossover to all martial arts, and depending on your skill level of interest, more or less. As being top elite in a specific competition will tend to reduce some crossover that works for generic training and a avg "foot soldier" level person. 


Just take any unarmed art that has functional reality and it'll all track well enough. You're not going to be a better fighter doing sword/stick strikes with your forearm, than if you know how to punch. 


Either take the associated art unarmed combat as FMA has. Or take like Muay Thai or another kickboxing. 


Or take Judo/BJJ and learn grappling, which translates great to real weapon fights and allows you to use strikes as set up/opener to the grappling. ... score: 0.64138

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely! This is actually a pretty common adaptation that many FMA practitioners explore. The biomechanics of stick and blade work translate surprisingly well to forearm strikes, especially the angles of attack and flow patterns. Your forearms essentially become your weapons, and the same 12 angles of attack in most Eskrima systems work great with forearm conditioning. However, you'll want to be careful about range - sticks give you extended reach that forearms obviously don't, so you'll need to adjust your distance management. For supplementary arts, I'd highly recommend Muay Thai for the clinch work and elbow techniques, plus some Panantukan (Filipino boxing) if you can find it, since it's specifically designed as the empty-hand component of FMA. Silat also pairs beautifully with this approach since it emphasizes similar flowing movements and limb destruction concepts. Just make sure you're conditioning your forearms properly - start light and build up gradually, or you'll end up with some nasty injuries that'll set back your training. ... score: 0.52853

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, a lot of Arnis/Eskrima techniques can be adapted to use the forearms, especially in empty hand combat scenarios. Many Filipino martial arts (FMA) systems have what’s called “panantukan” or “dirty boxing,” which is essentially the empty hand adaptation of their stick and blade movements. The motions you learn with a stick (angles, deflections, redirections) can be mirrored with your arms, and forearm strikes can be very effective, especially in close quarters. Forearm shots can be used for blocking, parrying, and striking (think hammerfist, ridge hand, or elbow-like motions). To supplement your training, you might want to look into Muay Thai for its clinch work and elbow/forearm strikes, or even boxing for its hand and arm mechanics. Kali/Arnis instructors who focus on the “empty hand” side of things (like Panantukan or Dumog) would be perfect, as they often bridge the gap between weapon and empty hand applications. Just make sure your forearms are conditioned properly to avoid injury! ... score: 0.51769

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Absolutely, adapting Arnis/Eskrima techniques to forearm strikes can be viable in empty-hand combat, especially if your forearms are well-conditioned. Traditional Arnis emphasizes weapon-based movement, angles, and timing, which can translate effectively to forearm strikes, blocks, and parries. The forearm can be used for powerful blocks, checks, and even offensive strikes, mimicking the stick’s linear motions but with added versatility since it’s part of your body. To supplement this, learning arts like Muay Thai for clinch work and conditioning, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for grappling transitions, and perhaps Filipino Martial Arts empty-hand systems like Panantukan (Filipino boxing) could round out your skill set. Panantukan specifically bridges the gap between weapon-based and empty-hand combat, focusing on similar angles, traps, and strikes with hands and forearms. Conditioning is key, so incorporating forearm strengthening exercises and impact conditioning drills would enhance the effectiveness. Overall, blending Eskrima principles with forearm strikes is not only viable but can create a unique and effective empty-hand fighting style. ... score: 0.47461

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the idea of adapting martial arts techniques to empty-hand combat, and using forearms in Arnis/Eskrima is an intriguing concept. The key to successfully applying these techniques would be to condition the forearms to withstand the impact, as well as to develop the proper technique and timing. It's essential to note that the forearms are not as durable as sticks or knives, so the strikes would need to be more precise and controlled. In terms of supplementing with other martial arts, I would recommend learning Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to improve grappling skills, as well as Muay Thai or Boxing to enhance striking techniques. By combining these martial arts, you could create a unique and effective fighting style that incorporates the principles of Arnis/Eskrima with the practicality of empty-hand combat. ... score: 0.50483

The forearm strikes you're suggesting could be a viable option, especially if you're looking for a way to condition your arms. However, keep in mind that without the added reach and leverage of a weapon, the dynamics of combat change significantly. You'll need to focus on footwork, evasion, and grappling techniques to make up for the lack of a weapon.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Forearm strikes can definitely be effective, but it's important to understand the biomechanics and risks involved. In Arnis/Eskrima, the stick serves as an extension of the arm, providing leverage and reach. When using your forearms, you lose some of that leverage, so you need to focus on generating power from your core and hips. I'd recommend checking out arts like Krav Maga or Systema, which both emphasize practical, no-nonsense techniques for self-defense. These systems can teach you how to deliver powerful strikes and defend against various attacks. Also, consider incorporating some boxing or kickboxing to improve your overall striking abilities and footwork. ... score: 0.54355

Post: Which chemistry set would you recommend?
I am a non-professional chemist and I am looking for a set of chemicals. About six years ago I got a chemistry kit. I have the equipment, however I don't have many chemicals. Idealy, I would want a kit of chemicals, that aren't in big quantities (such as 1kg) and I can do interesting experiments with them. Can you recommend a chemistry set? 

Thanks in advance!

Reddit author comment: My chemistry set consists of Amazon, aliexpress, ebay, walmart, canadian tire, home depot.... And a credit card.

"Interesting" really depends on what you want to do. To me, what's more important than the physical chemicals is the knowledge of how to get a reaction out of them. I pick a reaction i want to do, say make sodium metal, and then i go find the chemicals for it. In my case drain cleaner, magnesium firestarters, baby oil, menthol crystals, and energizer batteries. Then with some time and effort, i turn that into sodium metal... which i then throw into a bucket of water and make them explode.

If you're looking around for chemistry sets, see if you can download and review the manual first. That's the real gem of the set. See if the experiments are interesting and the kinds you want to do.

Alternatively, don't even get the set, see if you can source the individual chemicals domestically, thats a whole adventure in itself. 

Granted, my way might be a little expensive, i think i've blown maybe $80k on my hobby so far. ... score: 0.63736

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from - having the glassware but needing to restock on chemicals is a common situation. I'd highly recommend checking out **The Science Company** or **United Nuclear** for smaller quantities of reagents. They sell chemicals in much more reasonable amounts (like 25g-100g bottles) which is perfect for home experimentation. For interesting experiments, I'd suggest getting basics like copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium carbonate, citric acid, and some indicator solutions. You could also look into **Carolina Biological Supply** - they have educational chemical sets that come with smaller quantities specifically designed for demonstrations and experiments. Another great option is **Flinn Scientific**, though they primarily sell to educators, you might be able to purchase through them if you explain your educational interest.

Post: Light rail, SeaTac to downtown, is this feasible?
Will be visiting Seattle for a concert at Climate Pledge Arena.  I'm trying to avoid a rental car and parking.  I would like to take the light rail from the airport to downtown, stay in a hotel within walking distance of the arena, and get back to the airport by light rail.  Is this plan feasible?  I've mapped it and it looks easy enough.  Just looking for actual experience if I am setting myself up for a nightmare.  I've been to Seattle a few times, but never used the public transportation system.  Thanks!

Reddit author comment: Great answers for everyone, but I'll add a bit of context that may make things less confusing. Our light rail is called the Link. The downtown station is called Westlake. However, there are two different types of trains that come out of Westlake. The first is the Link which is underground at that point. The second is the monorail, which is on an elevated track. So if you want to take the train from Westlake to Seattle Center (the area where the stadium is), do not get on the Link. That will take you to Capitol Hill which is even further away from the arena. Get on the monorail. That will take you really close to the stadium. If you don't want to take the monorail there, it's a 1.5 mile walk. Just walk up second. ... score: 0.62785

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is absolutely feasible and honestly one of the best ways to get around Seattle for what you're planning! I've done this exact trip multiple times. The light rail (Link Light Rail) runs directly from SeaTac to downtown Seattle, and it's super convenient. The journey takes about 45-50 minutes from the airport to downtown stations like Westlake Center or University Street. Climate Pledge Arena is in Seattle Center, which is a bit north of the main downtown core, but totally walkable from hotels in Belltown or Lower Queen Anne - probably a 10-15 minute walk max. If you stay somewhere near the Westlake Center area, you might want to take the Seattle Center Monorail (it's like $3.50) which goes directly from downtown to Seattle Center, or just walk about 20 minutes. The light rail runs frequently (every 8-15 minutes depending on time of day) and is clean and reliable. Just make sure to check the schedule for your return trip to the airport, especially if your concert ends late - the last trains run around midnight on weekdays and 2 AM on weekends.

Post: Will expansion to 48 teams actually cause the World Cup to have 16 teams worse than Saudi Arabia?
**TL;DR**: No. Only 4-9 teams worse than Saudi Arabia would qualify


I wanted to post this on r/soccer, but they don't allow text posts, so I'm posting this here.



Since Saudi Arabia lost 5-0 to Russia, I have seen several claims that once the World Cup is expanded to 48 teams, it will include 16 teams worse than Saudia Arabia. I decided to test how many teams worse than Saudi Arabia would have qualified for this World Cup if it were a 48 team tournament. I defined a team worse than Saudi Arabia as one ranking lower on [FIFA’s ranking system](https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html) than Saudi Arabia (currently 67), and looked at both the qualification results, and the current FIFA world rankings (June 7, 2018) to see which teams would qualify. Throughout this post, FIFA rankings are included in parentheses next to a country’s name


AFC

Current - 4.5 Spots

Qualified - Iran (37), Japan (61), South Korea (57), Saudi Arabia (67), Australia (36, won intercontinental playoff against Honduras)

These are the top 5 AFC teams by FIFA’s ranking system.

Under the expansion, AFC gets 8 teams, which would add Syria (73), China (75) and UAE (77) based on the rating system. Based on the actual qualification results, taking the top 4 teams from each of the final groups would put Uzbekistan (95) in the World Cup instead of China. Ultimately, this would add 3 teams that are worse than Saudi Arabia.


CAF

Current - 5 Spots

Qualified - Tunisia (21), Nigeria (48), Morocco (41), Senegal (27), Egypt (45)

Top 5 by FIFA’s ranking system: Tunisia, Senegal, DR Congo (38), Morocco, Egypt

Under the expansion, AFC gets 9 teams, which would add DR Congo, Ghana (47), Cameroon (49), and Burkina Faso (52) based on the rating system. The actual qualification ended with 5 groups of 4 teams. Taking the best 4 runners-up would add DR Congo, Burkina Faso, Uganda (82), and either Ivory Coast (68). Ultimately, this adds at most 2 teams worse than Saudi Arabia.


CONCACAF

Current - 3.5 Spots

Qualified - Mexico (15), Costa Rica (23), Panama (55). (Honduras lost intercontinental playoff against Australia)

Top 4 by FIFA’s ranking system: Mexico, Costa Rica, USA (25), Jamaica (54)

Under the expansion, CONCACAF gets 6 teams, which would add USA, Jamaica, and Honduras (62), based on the rating system. The actual qualification ended with a group of six, featuring Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, USA, and Trinidad and Tobago (91). Ultimately, this adds at most 1 team worse than Saudi Arabia.


CONMEBOL

Current - 4.5 Spots

Qualified - Brazil (2), Uruguay (14), Argentina (5), Colombia (16), Peru (11) (Won intercontinental playoff against New Zealand)

Top 5 by FIFA’s ranking system: Brazil, Argentina, Chile (11), Peru, Uruguay

Under the expansion, CONMEBOL gets 6 spots, which would give Chile a spot based on both ranking and on qualification results. This adds no teams worse than Saudi Arabia.


OFC

Current - 0.5 Spots

Qualified - None. (New Zealand lost intercontinental playoff against Peru)

Top team by FIFA’s ranking system: New Zealand (120)

Under the expansion, OFC gets one spot, which would give New Zealand a spot based on both ranking and on qualification results. This adds 1 team worse than Saudi Arabia.


UEFA

Current - 13 Spots (Plus Host)

Qualified - Russia (Host, 70), France (7), Portugal (4), Germany (1), Serbia (34), Poland (8), England (12), Spain (10), Belgium (3), Iceland (22), Switzerland (6), Croatia (20), Denmark (12), Sweden (24)

Top 13 teams by FIFA’s ranking system: Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, England, Netherlands (17), Wales (18), Italy (19), Croatia

Under the expansion, UEFA gets 16 spots, one of which would go to the host (Russia). Based on FIFA’s ranking system, the top 15 teams are Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, England, Netherlands, Wales, Italy, Croatia, Iceland (22), and Sweden (24). Notably, this excludes the actually qualified team Serbia.

Based on actual qualification results, the teams would be the actually qualified teams as well as two of the losers of the second round matches: Northern Ireland (29), Greece (44), Republic of Ireland (31), and Italy.

This adds no teams worse than Saudi Arabia, except for Russia. However, based on the match between Russia and Saudi Arabia, Russia is clearly better.


Playoff: The expansion allocates the last two spots to the winners of a playoff between 6 teams. Each confederation except UEFA provides one of these teams, and the host confederation gets the last spot. In this case, since UEFA is hosting, they would get the spot.

AFC: Based on ranking, Lebanon (79). Based on qualification results, China (75). Either way, the team is worse than Saudi Arabia.

CAF: Based on ranking, Mali (64). Based on qualification results, Zambia (76). This adds at most one team based on Saudi Arabia.

CONCACAF: Based on ranking, El Salvador (72). Based on qualification results, Guatemala (146). Either way, the team is worse than Saudi Arabia.

CONMEBOL: Based on ranking or qualification results, Paraguay (32). This team is not worse than Saudi Arabia.

OFC: Based on ranking or qualification results, Solomon Islands (143). This team is worse than Saudi Arabia.

UEFA: One of the remaining losers of the second round matches. Whichever is chosen, the team is not worse than Saudi Arabia.

The playoff contains 3-4 teams worse than Saudi Arabia, and at least 2 much better teams. Likely, the playoff is won by those teams.


Overall, the tournament adds 4-9 teams worse than Saudi Arabia, based on FIFA’s ranking system. This is a far cry from the 16 teams that some have claimed would be added. However, these results should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are based largely on FIFA’s ranking system, which has Russia as a worse team than Saudi Arabia. However, I do think it is fair to say that expanding the tournament will not add 16 teams worse than Saudi Arabia.

Edit: I have since reposted an improved version of this on r/soccer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8rodjj/will_expansion_to_48_teams_actually_cause_the/)

Reddit author comment: Firstly, you cannot rely on World rankings as a measure of quality. They are inherently flawed, with team like Poland able to game the system. They only play against very poor teams in friendlies, which means they rarely lose and are rewarded with a high ranking place.

Secondly, Russia are ranked lower than Saudi as they have not played any competitive football. As the host qualifies automatically, they are unable to attribute any competitive ranking points.

If you want to see the best teams in the world, you would award more places to Europe. But, the question is whether the World Cup should be about representing the whole world or having the best teams. ... score: 0.62656

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is actually a really well-researched post that challenges a lot of the lazy assumptions people make about World Cup expansion. I've seen so many comments on r/soccer and other football forums where people just assume that going to 48 teams means we're going to get a bunch of absolute minnows who will get destroyed 10-0 every match. Your analysis shows that's just not the case - we're talking about maybe 4-9 teams that rank lower than Saudi Arabia, not 16. And honestly, using Saudi Arabia as the benchmark is pretty arbitrary anyway since they had a decent qualifying campaign and just had a nightmare against Russia (who clearly aren't as bad as their FIFA ranking suggests). The reality is that teams like Italy, Netherlands, Chile, and USA would have made it under the expanded format, and those are all quality sides that probably deserved to be there more than some teams that did qualify. I think people forget that the current 32-team format already includes some pretty weak teams, and the gap between the 32nd best team and the 40th best team in the world really isn't that massive. The expanded format might actually make the tournament more interesting in the group stages. ... score: 0.58139

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Great analysis! I think a lot of people are just reacting emotionally to the idea of expansion rather than looking at the numbers. Sure, there will always be a few teams that seem out of their depth, but the claim that “16 teams worse than Saudi Arabia” will qualify is just lazy exaggeration. As you pointed out, most of the “new” teams would still be from regions with decent footballing pedigree, and some like DR Congo, Ghana, or Chile are hardly “bad” teams. And regarding the FIFA rankings, while they’re not perfect, they’re at least a consistent benchmark. Plus, football is unpredictable—Saudi Arabia beat Argentina in 2022!

The FIFA ranking system isn’t perfect, but it’s a decent indicator here, and your breakdown by confederation is super helpful. The fact that we’re looking at maybe 4 to 9 teams worse than Saudi Arabia instead of 16 completely changes the narrative. Plus, expanding gives more nations a chance to experience the World Cup atmosphere and develop their football culture, which is important for the global growth of the game.

I'm still a bit skeptical about the quality of some of the teams that might get in, but it's definitely not as dire as some people are making it out to be. I think the real benefit of the expansion is that it will give more countries a chance to participate in the World Cup, which is a huge deal for football development in those regions. It's also exciting for fans of those teams who might not otherwise get to see their country represented on the biggest stage.

Post: What are the current technological limitations on terraforming?
For example, with desertification happening in a ton of places around the world, what, outside of monetary cost, is limiting changing climates on a reasonable scale?

Reddit author comment: Other than money? Time, resources, manpower and tech, mostly. The scale of the planet is immense. Even changing a tiny part of it takes years. For example, the Suez canal is only 600ft wide and 120 miles long, but it took 10 years to complete, even with heavy machinery helping for most of it. Granted, it was built quite a while ago. With today's tech, they could probably get it done a lot faster, but it would still take at least a year or two. 

Terrforming in any scope is a huge undertaking. Terraforming to change climates on a large scale is astronomic. Not to say we shouldn't try.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: The biggest limitation is honestly the sheer scale and complexity of climate systems. When we talk about terraforming or even just reversing desertification, we're dealing with interconnected systems that we still don't fully understand. Take atmospheric composition - even small changes can have massive cascading effects. We can plant trees and install solar panels, but creating sustainable water cycles, maintaining soil chemistry, and establishing stable ecosystems requires technology we're still developing. The energy requirements alone are staggering. Plus, many of our current geoengineering proposals are theoretical at best.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: One of the biggest technological limitations to large-scale terraforming or reversing desertification is our relatively limited ability to manipulate regional or global climates in a controlled way. We can plant trees, irrigate, and use certain soil amendments to rehabilitate small areas, but scaling that up to entire regions is a different challenge. The atmosphere and climate systems are incredibly complex, and any intervention could have unintended consequences. For example, cloud seeding has been tried in some places, but the results are unpredictable and sometimes negligible. We also lack materials and machinery robust enough to handle harsh environments at scale—think of the logistics of irrigating the entire Sahara. So, aside from money, the main issues are the limits of our understanding of climate science, the unpredictability of large-scale interventions, and the lack of robust, scalable technology. ... score: 0.55647

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: One major technological limitation when it comes to terraforming or large-scale climate modification is the sheer complexity of Earth's ecosystems. Even small changes in temperature, humidity, or soil chemistry can have unpredictable ripple effects on local flora and fauna. While we have some tools for localized interventions—like irrigation projects or reforestation efforts—scaling those up to effectively reverse desertification or alter climate patterns is a different beast altogether. We’re also limited by our ability to accurately model and predict how these interventions will interact with natural systems over time. Without precise control, attempts at large-scale climate engineering could backfire or cause unintended ecological damage. ... score: 0.52259

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a space enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the concept of terraforming, and I believe that understanding the current technological limitations is crucial for making progress in this field. One of the primary limitations is our current understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, geology, and life on Earth. We still have much to learn about how these systems interact and respond to changes, which makes it challenging to predict the outcomes of large-scale terraforming efforts. Moreover, even if we had a thorough understanding of these interactions, we would need significant technological advancements in areas such as climate engineering, geoengineering, and biotechnology to make meaningful changes to a planet's environment. For instance, we would need to develop more efficient and scalable methods for capturing and utilizing CO2, as well as technologies that can simulate the effects of a stable and self-sustaining ecosystem. Another significant limitation is the sheer scale of terraforming efforts, which would require massive amounts of resources, including energy, materials, and labor. However, I believe that by continuing to advance our understanding of the underlying science and developing new technologies, we can overcome these limitations and make terraforming a reality in the future. ... score: 0.55363

I know they were trying to market to mobile phone carriers because in many places in the world, there is no internet but there is a  mobile phone antenna and their coin would be sendable through phone carriers via codes that owners could punch in.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been following Telcoin for a while now and you're absolutely right about the lack of mainstream attention. The Nebraska banking charter approval is HUGE - like historically significant for crypto adoption in the US. What really gets me is that everyone's always complaining about crypto not having "real world utility" and here's Telcoin literally building infrastructure to connect traditional banking with crypto services. The remittance market they're targeting is massive, especially for underbanked populations who get crushed by traditional money transfer fees. The fact that they can legally issue stablecoins while regulators are cracking down everywhere else shows they've done their homework on compliance. I think the problem is that Telcoin doesn't have the flashy marketing or celebrity endorsements that pump other coins. They're just quietly building actual infrastructure while everyone else chases meme coins. The telecom partnerships and Fed rail access could be game-changing for financial inclusion.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from – Telcoin is one of those projects that has been grinding for years, staying relatively under the radar while quietly making huge regulatory moves. Most crypto hype is focused on flashy DeFi protocols, meme coins, or whatever is pumping, but Telcoin’s approach is more foundational. The Nebraska bank charter is huge: direct access to Fed rails for a crypto-native entity is almost unheard of. The fact that they’re targeting remittances with legal, compliant stablecoins for corridors like the US-Mexico and US-Philippines is a massively underserved area. It could have a real-world impact for millions, not just speculators. I think part of the reason for the lack of coverage is that Telcoin doesn’t market aggressively and isn’t VC-backed like other shiny projects. Also, their tech is a bit behind-the-scenes – unless you’re really following the regulatory crypto space, it’s easy to miss.

Getting conditional approval for a US Digital Asset Bank charter is HUGE, especially since it means direct access to Fed rails, which no other crypto company has managed so far. This isn’t just hype or speculation; it’s real infrastructure that could revolutionize how remittances are handled globally. The focus on dollar-backed stablecoins for major remittance corridors like the US, Mexico, and the Philippines is exactly what crypto needs — practical use cases that improve everyday financial transactions. It’s baffling that mainstream crypto media barely covers this because it challenges the narrative that crypto is only speculative. Telcoin survived bear markets, regulatory hurdles, and still keeps building solid tech and partnerships. The telecom integration and the token usage in their ecosystem could also drive real token demand, which is rare.

Post: At what age do medical bills start hitting?
I do ask this because I see a lot speak on here about how high the medical costs are on owning a ferret, but I’m a couple years in and haven’t really had to spend a thing, is there a certain age where it all starts just coming? Or are there many other people who actually have had real healthy ferrets, or does that just not happen.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've had ferrets for about 8 years now and can share my experience with the medical costs timeline. My first ferret was completely healthy until around 4-5 years old, then it was like a switch flipped. Within six months we went from zero vet bills to dealing with insulinomas, which required surgery and ongoing medication that cost about $200/month. My second ferret started having adrenal issues at 3 years old. The thing about ferret medical costs isn't necessarily that they're constantly sick, but when they do get sick, the treatments are expensive because they're considered exotic pets. Many vets charge higher fees for ferrets, and the medications often need to be specially compounded. I'd say most ferrets start showing age-related health issues between 3-6 years old, with 4-5 being pretty common.

Younger ferrets tend to be pretty resilient, and if you keep up with regular vet checkups and a good diet, you might avoid some of the common problems for a while. That said, ferrets are prone to certain illnesses like insulinoma and adrenal disease, which often develop later in life and can get expensive to manage.

Post: New to Power Stations
I was interested in a power station and, being new to the scene, knew nothing about them for the most part. I ordered a Powerfort 200W and it lasted long enough to charge two phones once and pump our air mattress for about one minute before dying.

I'm looking at the AC180 and the AC200L and can't determine which would be better value in my use case.

I'm looking to use it as an upgrade to my camping setup. I don't use much in regard to power, but I'll need to be able to charge two phones, keep a few 18650 flashlights charged, pump up maintain and deflate an air mattress with a built-in pump, possibly run a fan at night for two or three nights at a time, and maybe even a small projector for a movie or two. I'm sure I'll eventually find something else I'd like to run as well, but for now that's all I can think of. I'd rather buy once cry once, but I also don't want to go overboard and have to haul a huge unit for mile long hike-in sites.

Any suggestions?

Reddit author comment: Calculate the load you'll be putting on it and you can calculate the runtime.  It looks like those units are 1152 Watt Hours and 2048Wh respectively.  This means you get at 120V about 9Ah or 17Ah of runtime respectively.  You'd need to add up your loads based on their rated draw which should be listed on their adapters and you can estimate the combined runtime you'd get.  As an example, my fan pulls 45W at 120V meaning it's amp load (W=V\*A) would be 24W/120V= 0.375A per hour so if that was all I was running I could expect to get 24 hours and 45 hours respectively from those packs. ... score: 0.65156

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally feel your pain with that Powerfort - sounds like you got burned by one of those cheap knockoff brands that flood the market. The AC180 vs AC200L is actually a great comparison to be making, and honestly both are solid Bluetti units that'll blow your old power station out of the water. For your specific use case, I'd lean toward the AC180. Here's why: it's got 1152Wh capacity which should easily handle 2-3 nights of your described usage, it weighs about 35 pounds (vs 46 for the AC200L), and the price difference is significant. Your power needs are pretty modest - phone charging uses maybe 10-15Wh per charge, 18650 flashlight charging is minimal, air mattress pumping is brief high draw, and even a small fan running overnight might use 50-100Wh. The AC180's 1800W inverter can handle that air mattress pump no problem, and you'll still have plenty of headroom for future additions. The AC200L's extra capacity (2048Wh) is nice but probably overkill for your current needs, and that extra 11 pounds really adds up on hike-in sites. Save the money and weight - the AC180 should serve you well for years. ... score: 0.58084

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I think you’re already on the right track by looking to upgrade from something like the Powerfort 200W, which, as you found out, is mostly for emergency top-ups rather than real camping power needs. Between the AC180 and AC200L, both are massive upgrades, but they have their trade-offs. The AC180 is quite a bit lighter and more portable at around 35 lbs, making it more suitable for hike-in campsites if you don’t want to be miserable hauling gear. Its battery should easily handle your listed uses for a couple of days—phone charging, flashlights, mattress pump, fan, and even a projector for a movie night. The AC200L, on the other hand, is a beast with much more capacity and output, but it’s over 60 lbs and pretty bulky. Unless you plan to run high-draw appliances or extend your trips to four nights or more without recharging, the AC180 seems like the sweet spot for portability and capacity.

Based on what you described, both the AC180 and AC200L could meet your needs, but there are some important differences to consider. The AC200L has a much larger battery capacity (around 2000Wh vs. 180Wh), so it’ll easily handle charging phones, flashlights, running a fan overnight, and even your projector without breaking a sweat. The tradeoff is size and weight—it’s significantly heavier and bulkier, which might be a pain if you’re doing long hikes. The AC180 is more compact and lighter, but its smaller battery means you’ll have to recharge it more often, especially if you’re running things like a fan or projector. Since you want to “buy once cry once,” the AC200L seems like the better investment for multi-day trips, but if you prioritize portability and lighter load, the AC180 could work well for shorter or less power-hungry outings.

That being said, if you anticipate needing to power more devices in the future, the AC200L might be a better investment. It's also worth considering the types of devices you'll be using and their power requirements. For example, if you plan on using a lot of high-powered devices, the AC200L might be a better choice.

Reddit author comment: 3D printing is a bad idea. You can probably buy replacement soles; if not, your boots are too old and you should replace the whole boot. 



"Just plastic" -- not all plastic is the same. All sorts of different plastic exist; the one chosen by the ski manufacturer is chosen because it is strong in the temperatures that ski boots live in. Even for the same plastic, different manufacture methods will give different properties. Ski boot soles will be injection moulded which means that they will be strong and pretty much uniform in terms of strength in all directions; 3d printing will create parts with specific weaknesses along layer lines. The injection moulded part will have been thoroughly tested to make sure it doesn't break in all normal ski conditions; the same will not be true for a 3d printed part.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I'd be pretty cautious about 3D printing replacement parts for ski boots, especially anything that's load-bearing or safety-critical. While it might look like "just plastic," ski boot components are typically made from specialized materials that can handle extreme cold, repeated stress, and the forces involved in skiing. Standard 3D printing filaments like PLA or even ABS might not have the same durability, impact resistance, or temperature tolerance. If this is just a cosmetic outer shell piece that doesn't affect boot function or safety, it might be worth a shot, but I'd definitely recommend checking with the boot manufacturer first to see if replacement parts are available. You could also try contacting local ski shops - they sometimes have old boots they're parting out or can order OEM replacements. If you do go the 3D printing route, make sure your friend uses a high-quality, durable filament like PETG or nylon, and test it thoroughly before hitting the slopes. Your safety is worth more than saving a few bucks on proper replacement parts. ... score: 0.64512

The main thing you’ll want to consider is what kind of plastic you use—factory parts are often made from specific blends like TPU or other impact-resistant plastics. Some common 3D printer filaments like PLA can be pretty brittle, but materials like PETG or ABS are much stronger and might be suitable for this kind of application. There definitely is some risk of the parts failing, especially since ski boots go through a lot of flex and force, but if you’re just replacing a non-structural cover or something minor, it could work.

However, keep in mind that ski boots undergo a lot of stress and impact, so the material you use for printing is crucial. Standard PLA or ABS might not hold up well in cold temperatures or repeated flexing. You might want to look into more durable filaments like Nylon or PETG, which have better toughness and flexibility. Also, make sure the dimensions and screw holes are precise because any misalignment could affect the boot’s fit and performance. If your friend can print a few test pieces, maybe you can do some at-home stress tests before fully committing. If the 3D printed parts do break, it’s not like you’re out a ton of money compared to buying new boots or parts.

Post: How to determine pricing for licensing? 
Hi all!

Im a photographer who mostly shoots landscapes in my area, i upload them to my instagram and also have a portfolio website to showcase my work.

Recentely i had someone message me asking to license some of my images and drone videos for their business. This is a first for me as im a small photographer still. I have absolutely no clue how much i should be charging, and I dont know how to determine a good price.

Can anyone offer some tips or advice?  
Thanks!

Edit: Quoted them 575 AUD, for 5 photos and 2 videos. all high res and 4k. They ghosted me :/ unfortunately i think they went to a smaller photographer hoping to get it for an extremely low price. Considering this amount of content would have costed them thousands on stock websites, ig they still thought 575 was too high.

Reddit author comment: The correct answer is however much the market (or in this case your client) will pay.

How unique are the images?  Are similar photos on stock websites? 

I would try a pry for a budget from the client ; say something like you want to give them a package deal but want to see what kind of budget/number they need to be at. 

Does not mean you have to meet their number there may be room for negotiation. 

There really is no way to know.  The amounts for licensing vary tremendously and you have no idea what value the client has in mind.  Could be between $50-$1000 per image which is a massive range  (non-exclusive use).

Make sure you still keep future usage of your image ; if they want to buy the images to exclusively use them you could sell them but would be very expensive. This would mean you could not ever license the photos elsewhere. ... score: 0.61627

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: **u/PhotoPricingPro**: Don't let that ghosting discourage you - $575 AUD for 5 high-res photos and 2 4K videos is actually quite reasonable, especially for commercial licensing! You're absolutely right that this would cost them thousands on stock sites, and honestly, they probably weren't serious buyers if they balked at that price. Here's my advice for future licensing deals: always ask about their intended use first (web only, print, duration of license, exclusivity, etc.) because this dramatically affects pricing. For commercial use, I typically charge $150-300 per image for basic web licensing, more for print or exclusive rights. Videos command higher prices, especially 4K drone footage. Create a simple licensing agreement that specifies usage terms, duration, and territory. Don't undervalue your work - quality landscape and drone photography takes skill, expensive equipment, and often involves traveling to remote locations. The right clients will pay fair prices.

You’re right that 575 AUD for 5 high-res photos and 2 drone videos is actually a pretty reasonable, if not generous, rate by industry standards. The challenge is that many businesses (especially smaller ones) are used to finding dirt-cheap or even free visuals online, so there’s always someone willing to undercut you. One way to determine pricing is to consider how the images will be used (web, print, advertising, duration, exclusivity, geography). There are calculators online (like Getty Images’ or FotoQuote) that can help you estimate fair rates based on these factors.

Additionally, you might want to think about the different factors that can impact the value of your images, such as the intended use, the size and type of the business, and the level of exclusivity being requested. For example, if the images are going to be used in a major advertising campaign, you may be able to command a higher price than if they were simply being used on a small business's social media page. It's also worth considering the cost of producing the images, including your time, equipment, and any other expenses you incurred in order to capture the shots. By taking all of these factors into account, you should be able to arrive at a price that reflects the true value of your work and helps you to build a sustainable business. ... score: 0.50381

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: 1. Hi there! It's great that you're getting requests for licensing your work. Pricing can be tricky, but a good starting point is to consider the end use of the images. Are they for web use, print, or something else? Also, think about the size of the company that's licensing your images. Larger companies will typically have bigger budgets. You might also want to look at what other photographers are charging for similar work. Don't forget to factor in your time and expenses too. Good luck! ... score: 0.63295

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Considering this is your first time licensing your work and you're still building your portfolio, it's understandable to feel unsure about pricing. I would recommend doing a bit of market research to see what other photographers in your area or with similar expertise are charging. This can give you a good baseline. Additionally, you can break down your pricing into a few key factors: the cost of your time, the quality of your work, the exclusivity of the license, and the intended use by the client. For example, if the images are going to be used for a large, high-profile campaign, you might charge more than if they're just for a small, local business's website. ... score: 0.56067

Post: Which laptop should I buy in 2025?
I usually use my laptop for things that I believe are simple. I watch and download movies, browse the internet with many tabs open, use Word and Excel, and run screenwriting programs. And not much more.

Sometimes, for work-related reasons, I edit videos and photos. Right now, it’s not something I do frequently, but it might be in the future. So, it would be nice if my laptop could handle these tasks with ease.

I don’t play video games or do streaming.

With this in mind, what laptop would you recommend I buy in 2025? Considering that I hope my laptop will last me for several years and that I can make the most out of it.

One more thing: I love watching movies, so I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I suppose I’d prefer a screen that allows me to enjoy them. I mean good resolution and, maybe, a decent size. Right now, I have a laptop with a 16-inch screen.

One last thing: I work with a lot of files, and for example, my laptop's storage is currently almost full. Maybe this could be solved with an external hard drive or something similar. But I suppose I’d prefer a laptop that already comes with ample storage.

I guess it’s obvious to say that I’m looking for something good (something that meets the needs I described), aesthetically pleasing, and, if possible, affordable.

Alright, that’s all.  
Do you have any recommendations?  
I’m looking forward to your suggestions!

Reddit author comment: No laptop is going to last forever, tech just moves along too fast. I'd advise you buy something middle-of-the road so that the upgrades don't hurt so bad but also don't have to be every year.

One thing I'll mention is a Laptop company called Framework that creates modular laptops that can be easily repaired and upgraded, so in theory it could be a BIFL laptop in a ship-of-theseus kind of way. But you get less bank for your buck on the initial purchase and upgrades can still hurt the pocketbook depending on what you're changing out. Also there's no way of knowing if this company will be successful enough to still be around in 10 years. ... score: 0.65417

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Based on your needs, I'd strongly recommend looking at the MacBook Air M3 or waiting for the M4 version if it's released by the time you're buying. I know it might seem like overkill, but hear me out - the M3 chip handles video editing surprisingly well for occasional use, and the battery life is incredible for movie watching sessions. The 15-inch model would give you that larger screen you're used to, and the display quality is genuinely fantastic for movies with excellent color accuracy and brightness. For storage, definitely go for at least 512GB, though 1TB would be ideal given your file management concerns. The build quality means it'll easily last you 5-7 years, and macOS is great for creative work. Yes, it's pricier upfront, but the longevity and resale value make it worth it. Plus, Final Cut Pro (if you go the Mac route) is incredibly efficient for video editing. The only downside is you'll need adapters for ports, but the trade-off in performance and battery life is worth it. ... score: 0.63122

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Based on your needs, I think you’d be really happy with something like the Dell XPS 15 or the MacBook Air (M3, if it’s out by 2025) with at least 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. Both have excellent screens—Dell’s InfinityEdge display is especially nice for watching movies, and the MacBook’s Retina display is also top-notch. Since you want your laptop to last for several years and plan to maybe do more video/photo editing in the future, going for 16GB RAM and a mid-tier processor (like Intel i7/Apple M3) will help future-proof your purchase. The XPS line is known for its aesthetics, and MacBooks always look sleek. As for storage, 1TB is a safe minimum for someone who deals with lots of files. If you need even more, you can always supplement with an external SSD. Both options aren’t exactly “budget,” but you get solid build quality and longevity. If you want something more affordable, check out the ASUS Vivobook Pro 16 OLED—it’s got an amazing screen and good specs for the price! ... score: 0.61358

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey! Based on what you’ve described, I’d recommend looking into laptops with at least an Intel Core i5 or AMD Ryzen 5 processor from the 2024/2025 generation. These will be powerful enough for your everyday tasks like browsing, Word/Excel, and even light video/photo editing. Since you want a good screen for movies, consider a 16-inch or 17-inch display with at least a 1080p resolution, but if your budget allows, a 2.5K or 4K screen will make a noticeable difference in clarity and color vibrancy. For storage, aim for at least 512GB SSD, preferably 1TB if you handle lots of files and media. SSDs will ensure fast loading times. Also, since you’re concerned about future-proofing, 16GB of RAM is a sweet spot—enough for multitasking and heavier editing down the line. Brands like Dell XPS 15, MacBook Pro 16-inch (if you’re okay with macOS), or the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme are solid choices that look good and perform well. And yes, you can always add an external drive later if needed. Hope this helps! ... score: 0.64243

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a tech-savvy individual, I think you're making the right decision by considering your future needs when buying a laptop in 2025. Given your requirements, I'd recommend a laptop with at least 16 GB of RAM, a recent-generation processor (perhaps from Intel Core i5 or i7 series or AMD Ryzen 5 or 7 series), and a dedicated graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce or AMD Radeon) to handle video editing and photo editing tasks. For storage, I'd suggest opting for a laptop with a fast SSD (at least 512 GB) and considering an external hard drive for additional storage. A 16-inch or larger screen with good resolution (4K or QHD) would be perfect for watching movies. Some laptops that might fit your bill are the Dell XPS 16, MacBook Pro 16, or the HP Envy 16. When it comes to affordability, you can expect to pay anywhere from $800 to $2,000, depending on the specifications and brand. It's also worth considering the operating system you prefer, as some laptops might come with Windows, macOS, or even Chrome OS.

Post: Fast 911 response!
Yesterday we were having lunch at the food trucks at Burnside and Park when we noticed a young woman near us fall to the ground having a seizure.

I called 911 expecting to be on hold for a long time but the call was answered immediately. The operator was very helpful and had an ambulance on the way in moments. Once we were sure the woman was stabilized and breathing regularly, the 911 operator ended the call. Within anther minute or two we heard the siren and I flagged down the ambulance to be sure they found us quickly.

I just wanted to share a positive story, I've heard lots of anecdotes about people waiting on hold for ages when calling 911. Maybe things were slow yesterday afternoon or something, but they were on it fast!

Also hope the lady who had the seizure is doing OK.

Reddit author comment: Two weeks ago, we (spouse and I) also had a very fast 911 response when assisting an emergency at NE Glisan and NE 57th, right where there is an entrance and exit ramp for I-84. There was a car stalled out blocking both the on- and off-ramps. The occupants were freaking out, screaming, running around the car, and one woman had only one shoe on. It seems like the young man in the car was having an asthma attack, but not sure. One woman called 911 while several of us pushed the car to a safe spot out of traffic. The ambulance came within 5 minutes. They had told the woman on the phone it would be 20 minutes, but they made it within 5. We were all SO grateful for this rapid response, and hopeful that the Portland 911 system is recovering and doing better. ... score: 0.60657

Called 911 expecting the worst based on all the horror stories you hear, but they picked up on the second ring and had units dispatched within minutes. I think a lot of the bad experiences people share online might be from peak hours or major incidents that tie up resources. It's also worth noting that different areas have different response capabilities - some districts are just better funded and staffed than others.

Post: You've Ruined Phoenix For Me
Hi NYC,

It was only for a week but man did y'all show me a good time. I've lived in Arizona for 22 years (Phoenix for 12) and I thought I had a relatively free life... But man when you can take a train to almost anywhere you want to go and not worry about parking, gas being insanely expensive, traffic jams.. it's just a better way of travel. 

Thanks for an amazing week of freedom!!

Reddit author comment: As someone who moved from NYC to Phoenix. I have to disagree. NYC is so much fun, unlimited options for dining, nightlife, arts, culture, etc. and very easy to get around via subway. However, if you are sick you will be waiting in line for hours to get checked out, to have your prescriptions filled, etc. The freedom cuts out at times. for example during the Nye ball drop my entire block was blocked off and I couldn’t go back to my place until the barricades were removed very late/ early in the morning. The weather is terrible for 7 months per year (I’ll take the heat over the freezing cold). NYC is an awesome place, it’s where i’m from. However Phoenix is really the place with more freedom.

The public transit here isn't perfect - delays, crazy people on the subway, occasional smell issues - but the FREEDOM is unreal. I remember in Phoenix I had to plan my entire day around driving times and parking situations. Want to grab drinks with friends? Better figure out who's the designated driver or shell out $30+ for an Uber. Here I can bar hop across three different neighborhoods and just hop on the train home. And don't even get me started on grocery shopping - being able to walk to three different bodegas and two supermarkets within a few blocks versus having to drive 15 minutes to the nearest decent grocery store in Phoenix. The walkability factor alone changed my entire lifestyle. I walk like 10,000+ steps a day now without even trying, whereas in Phoenix I was basically sedentary unless I specifically went to the gym. ... score: 0.54075

Reddit author comment: Hi everyone,

All the people around me keep telling me I should invest. Now, in my late 20s, I finally have more money than I spend, so I’m ready to take the first step. The problem is: I have zero clue about ETFs and stocks. That’s why I wanted to ask for your opinion on my plan before I jump in:

I want to invest for at least 15+ years and keep the risk as low as possible. Based on that, I came up with the following ETF portfolio and allocations:

60% MSCI World (A1XB5U)

8% MSCI World ex USA (DBX0VH)

24% Emerging Markets IMI (A111X9)

8% FTSE India (A2PB5W)


Idea behind ex USA + India: I wanted to slightly reduce the heavy focus on the USA in the typical world ETF and add more exposure to India.

Post: 7 years as a skier.. this is my first year boarding and I’ve gone 16 times in the 24/25 season. Is it worth buying my own setup? Board/gear recommendations?
Like the title mentioned this is my first year riding. I had a lesson in late December and never looked back. 

I was on a rental board for $300 for the season but I wanted to know if I’m riding enough for my own setup. And if I am what boards should I be looking at? 

If possible I’d like to buy with USA made products so I’ve heard never summer,GNU and lib tech all make them in the states. As for boots and bindings I’m not sure. 

Any recommendations or advice would be appreciated. I ride fast and don’t go into park much. I’d like to do some powder eventually next season but I’m typically on groomers.

Reddit author comment: If ur dedicated absolutely
You will progress so much faster w your own setup

Boots is most important you can always splurge on those and get the rest later if u wanna save money
But w your own setup u won't waste time adjusting to the feeling of different boots/bindings/board that the rental store gives you - u can focus on getting better each time u show up

As a beginner look for boots that are not too stiff 
Bindings and board nothing more than mid stiffness  and a profile that isn't full camber.. camber is more locked in but unforgiving - u can't be as sloppy w technique or ul catch an edge and eat shit ... score: 0.55245

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely worth getting your own setup at 16+ days! You've already spent $300 on rentals this season, so investing in your own gear makes total sense financially and performance-wise. For your riding style (fast, groomers, future powder), I'd highly recommend looking at Never Summer's Proto Type Two or West Bound - both are camber-dominant boards that excel at carving and high speeds while still being versatile enough for powder days. GNU and Lib Tech are solid choices too, with Lib Tech's T.Rice Pro being a beast for aggressive all-mountain riding. For boots, don't overlook the importance of proper fit - brands like Burton, Vans, and ThirtyTwo make quality boots, though not all are USA-made. Bindings-wise, Union (made in Italy but excellent quality) or Burton Genesis are worth considering. Having your own gear will dramatically improve your progression since you'll get consistent feel and response every time you ride. ... score: 0.66146

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, with 16 days in a season already, you’re definitely riding enough to justify getting your own setup. Rentals are great to get started, but having your own board tailored to your style and fit makes a huge difference in comfort and progression. USA-made brands like Never Summer, GNU, and Lib Tech are all solid choices—Never Summer especially has a reputation for durability and great edge hold on groomers, which sounds like your main terrain. For bindings, Union and Burton both make reliable options, but if you want to stick with US-made, check out Bent Metal (owned by Mervin, who also makes GNU and Lib Tech). Boot fit is super personal—definitely try on a bunch in-store and prioritize comfort and support. If you see powder in your future, consider an all-mountain board with a bit of setback and some rocker in the nose for float, but since you’re mostly on groomers, something with camber or hybrid camber will give you lots of control and speed. Good luck and welcome to the dark side! ... score: 0.59278

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Honestly, if you’ve already gone 16 times this season and plan to keep riding next season, investing in your own setup can definitely be worth it. Rentals are convenient, but owning your own board, boots, and bindings will give you a better fit, more comfort, and improved performance. Since you’re riding fast and mostly on groomers, you’ll want a board that excels on hardpack and can handle speed well. GNU and Lib Tech are solid choices, especially since you’re looking for USA-made products. I’d suggest looking at something with a directional shape and a medium-stiff flex to match your style. For boots and bindings, definitely try them on in-store because fit is everything. Brands like Burton and ThirtyTwo have good USA-made options, but you might want to check out Union bindings since they’re also high quality and made in the USA. Powder boards tend to be longer and wider, so maybe get a setup that can do both groomers and occasional powder runs. Overall, owning your own gear will enhance your experience and probably save you money in the long run if you keep riding regularly. ... score: 0.60988

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a fellow skier-turned-boarder, I must say that I'm stoked to see you've caught the bug and are thinking of investing in your own setup. Buying your own gear can be a game-changer, especially if you're planning to ride as frequently as you have been this season. Not only will you save money in the long run, but you'll also be able to customize your setup to fit your riding style. Since you mentioned you're looking to buy USA-made products, I'd definitely recommend checking out Never Summer, GNU, and Lib Tech, as you've already mentioned. They all offer high-quality boards that are perfect for all-mountain riding. For boots and bindings, you might want to consider looking into brands like Burton, Ride, and Salomon. They offer a wide range of options that cater to different riding styles and preferences. As for your riding style, it sounds like you're a speed demon, and you'll likely want a board that can keep up with you. I'd recommend looking into boards with a stiffer flex, such as the Never Summer Proto or the GNU Mullair. These boards are designed for all-mountain riding and can handle high speeds with ease. Additionally, you may want to consider looking into boards with a directional shape, as they tend to perform better in powder and at high speeds. ... score: 0.63293

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: 1. Hey there! I made the switch from skiing to snowboarding a few years ago, and it was definitely worth investing in my own setup. Given your riding style and preference for USA-made products, I'd recommend checking out the Never Summer Proto Synthesis or GNU Riders Choice. Both boards are versatile and can handle speed well. For boots, consider the Burton Ion or Ride Lasso, and for bindings, the Union Strata or Burton Cartel. Good luck with your new setup! ... score: 0.71314

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Absolutely, it's worth buying your own setup if you're hitting the slopes 16 times a season. Owning your gear can significantly enhance your experience and performance. Since you're riding fast and mostly on groomers, with a goal to try powder, I'd recommend a versatile all-mountain board. Never Summer's Capita Gunner is a great choice for its stability and performance on both groomers and powder. For boots, consider the Burton Custom Boa, which offers a great balance of comfort and responsiveness. As for bindings, the Gnu Good Banana C2 is a solid choice, known for its smooth performance and durability. All these brands are made in the USA, aligning with your preference. Enjoy your riding and the new gear! ... score: 0.66568

Post: Washer recommendations for family of seven?
I've looked through some of the more recently BIFL recommendations for washers and I'm not sure a Speed Queen is necessarily the right choice for us. 

Back story: Our washer (20yo Whirlpool front loader) was overloaded and it appears that the drum stripped the seal between inside and the drain so water got into the electronics and caused error codes, drum will no longer spin. Given that both the seal is stripped and the electronics appeared to have gotten wet, I'm not sure it's even worth it to pay to have a technician out (if you think it is, I'll look into it). 

We have five kids, 11-3. The amount of laundry is only going to increase as they grow and get more involved in activities and, as children are wont to do as they age, stinkier. I need something that has large enough capacity for comforters and bedding, but doesn't beat the heck out of them. We had a whirlpool top loader before and it worked really well, but I don't love rebalancing top loaders because a towel ends up in the wrong place when they start to spin. I was skeptical about the front loader when we moved here, but it's worked really well and does a good job cleaning our clothes. Also, since it doesn't have the agitator, there's enough room to wash quilts or decent size loads of clothing. I use pods almost exclusively at this point because they're easy for my kids to use too. 

I'd like to keep it under $2000 if I can, and I'm all right with getting something that's semi-BIFL if it does a really good job cleaning clothes and doesn't waste a ton of water. 

Reddit author comment: I tested appliances for nearly 30 years. While Samsung and LG often get high reviews, their reliability is terrible, the parts are difficult to come by and they are expensive to repair. 

I’ve had a Speed Queen since 1980 and with some regular maintenance it has performed flawlessly. However, the newer models are not as reliable and may no longer justify the price.

Front loaders are very popular, but they have a lot of issues with odors and mold unless you are extremely consistent in how you care for them.  Buy a basic top loader from Maytag or GE (parts are readily available and repairs reasonable) for $800-$1200 and if you have a local appliance store near you, I would highly suggest buying from them as opposed to a big box store. You will get far better, more knowledgeable service. Good luck. ... score: 0.64401

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally get your situation - with five kids, you need something that can handle serious volume without breaking the bank. I'd actually push back a bit on dismissing Speed Queen entirely. Yes, their top loaders have agitators, but their front loaders (like the FF7) are workhorses that can handle your capacity needs without the rebalancing issues. That said, if you want to stick under $2000 and get great cleaning performance, I'd seriously look at the LG WM4000HWA or Samsung WF45R6100. Both have 4.5+ cubic foot capacity, which should handle your comforters and large loads easily. The LG especially has excellent cleaning performance and is surprisingly gentle on fabrics. I've had mine for 4 years with three kids and it's been bulletproof. The Samsung has great smart features too if that matters to you. Both work perfectly with pods and have steam cycles that are amazing for getting out those stubborn kid stains and odors. You might also want to consider getting a matching dryer at the same time - many retailers offer bundle deals that could keep you right around your budget while ensuring both units work well together. ... score: 0.57211

gpt4.1-instruct comment: For a family of seven, I’d recommend looking at the LG and Samsung front loaders, especially the larger capacity models (5 cu ft or more). We have an LG WM4000HWA (I think the newer version is the WM4200HWA), and it’s been a workhorse for our family of six. The drum is huge—we can fit a king-size comforter or a week’s worth of kids’ clothes in one go, and it does a really thorough job cleaning without tearing up fabric. It’s also super gentle on bedding and delicates, and the cycle times are reasonable. I know Speed Queen gets a lot of love here, but for big families that need volume and want to avoid agitators, the high-end LGs just make life easier. Ours is three years old and going strong, and the direct drive motors on these are supposed to last. They’re usually well under $2,000, even for the top-tier model. Also, they pair well with pods—no residue issues. If you want reliability with capacity, I’d say LG front loaders are hard to beat right now. ... score: 0.64399

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from with the Speed Queen hesitation—those are built tough, but sometimes the price and the industrial feel can be a bit much for a family setting. Given your needs, I’d suggest looking into high-capacity front loaders from brands like LG or Samsung. Their newer models tend to have larger drums that can handle bulky items like comforters without compromising on cleaning performance. Plus, they generally have good reliability ratings and smart features like steam cleaning and allergen cycles, which might help with the “stinkier” sports gear you mentioned. Also, many models now include vibration reduction technology to help with rebalancing, so you won’t have to babysit loads as much. Staying under $2000 is definitely possible with these brands, especially if you catch sales or go for last year’s models. One thing to watch out for is maintenance—front loaders can develop mold issues if not aired out properly, so keep the door open after cycles. Overall, a quality LG or Samsung front loader might be a good middle ground between heavy-duty commercial washers and your old Whirlpool. ... score: 0.55232

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think you're on the right track considering a Speed Queen, but I also understand your reservations given your large family and the specific needs you've outlined. One thing to keep in mind is that Speed Queen washers are known for their durability and ability to handle heavy loads, but they can be quite rough on clothes, especially delicates. If you're looking for a gentle cycle for comforters and bedding, you might want to consider other options. That being said, Speed Queen does offer some higher-end models with advanced features like steam cleaning and sanitizing, which could be beneficial for a family with young children. These models might be worth exploring, but be prepared for a higher price point. Another option to consider is the Maytag Bravos line, which offers a range of capacities and features, including a gentle cycle for delicates. Maytag is known for its reliability and performance, and the Bravos line is designed to handle heavy loads and large families. Ultimately, the decision will depend on your specific needs and priorities, but I think it's worth doing some more research and reading reviews to find the best fit for your family. ... score: 0.48484

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Hi there! I've been in a similar situation with a family of six, and we opted for the LG WM4000HWA. It's a front-loader with a large capacity and does a fantastic job cleaning clothes. The machine is also gentle on fabrics, so your comforters and bedding will be safe. It's not a BIFL machine, but it comes with a 1-year parts and labor warranty, and the LG brand is known for its reliability.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I completely understand your situation, and it sounds like you need a reliable, high-capacity washer that can handle the demands of a large family. One option that I've had great success with is the LG TWINWash. It has a large 4.5 cubic foot capacity, which is perfect for big loads of laundry, including comforters and bedding. The TWINWash also has a steam cleaning feature that helps remove tough stains and odors, which is perfect for kids' clothes. The best part is that it has a secondary, smaller washer that you can use for more delicate items or smaller loads, which can save water and energy. It’s a bit of an investment, but it’s definitely worth it if you can stretch your budget a bit. Plus, LG has a good reputation for durability and customer support. I’ve had mine for a few years now, and it has handled everything my family has thrown at it. If you’re looking for something a bit more affordable, the Samsung WA50M9700AV might be a great fit. It has a 5.0 cubic foot capacity and a lot of smart features, including a steam cleaning option and a built-in dryer sensor. Both of these washers are front-loading, which you mentioned you prefer, and they both have large enough capacities to handle your family’s needs without being too rough on your clothes. ... score: 0.52048
