Post: [Discussion]: Let's talk about this translations from Russian (modern poet, Olga Popova, translated by Alina Dezent)
May I ask you if these translations sound good for English speaking audience. Thanks!

\*\*\*\*\*

The air vibrates from the chirping of cicadas,

See how polished are their fiddles!

They paganini, and scrub, and shriek,

In the hazy heat, in hazy times.

&#x200B;

They rub their wings off the Parca’s thread,

How they bash out that tune, wild creatures,

The thread can be easily thinned to the end

Once the musicians are in their element.

\*\*\*

here it is, the green-streamed Aegean Sea

most beautiful by the visage and color,

its wild waves beat the rocks with severe blasts,

its streams caress the beach with a warm wave.

&#x200B;

but to play with you, oh sea, is risky,

salty is your brine and it burns like tears,

breaks the flesh and silvers my braids,

swings me on its waves and beckons farther and farther.

&#x200B;

Why is it, oh sea, that I don’t understand you?

I see your waves splashing by the board of the trireme,

I hear your captivating voice - the wind in my ears,

closer is your fierce eye, your beastly roar.

&#x200B;

wine-colored, you swing in a tight embrace

you intoxicate and burn, caress and ruin.

horns on your head, waves full of wailing.

the raving maidens stomp as they dance, their lips in blood and foam.

Reddit author comment: The second to me has something of the crash of the waves against the shore.  I wasn't keen on the format on the first reading but on the second it speaks to me more and I hear it.  I like it, the ebb and flow of it.

For the first one I found myself caught on the capitalization of parka...  Couldn't see why it was done, tried to find a meaning but failed, and that made it hard for me to catch the tone back up.  Is there a reason for the capitalization?  I kind of like the word paganini there, it works for me...  Although it startled me, rather than evokes.  I'm not as familiar with music as I should be, and it brings out what I think that should be rather than what I know, since I can't call to mind any tune. ... score: 0.26686

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: These translations have some beautiful moments but feel inconsistent in their execution. The first poem about cicadas has an intriguing concept - comparing the insects to musicians playing until they literally wear themselves out against fate's thread (the Parca reference). However, there are some awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow for English readers. "They paganini" as a verb is creative but jarring, and "How they bash out that tune" feels too colloquial compared to the more elevated tone elsewhere. The second poem about the Aegean Sea is much stronger overall. The imagery is vivid and the personification of the sea as both seductive and dangerous works well. Lines like "salty is your brine and it burns like tears" and "wine-colored, you swing in a tight embrace" are genuinely beautiful. The progression from attraction to fear to intoxication feels natural. My main critique would be some minor word choices - "visage" feels slightly archaic, and "by the board of the trireme" could be clearer. The translator has captured what seems to be the original's blend of classical imagery with modern sensibility, but the English could be polished to flow more naturally while preserving the poetic intensity. ... score: 0.37079

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I think these translations do a pretty good job of conveying vivid imagery and emotional undertones, but they do feel a bit "foreign" to an English ear—not in a bad way, but in a way that makes you aware it’s translated. For example, lines like "They paganini, and scrub, and shriek," stand out because "Paganini" as a verb is unusual. I get what it’s trying to say (the cicadas play their fiddles with virtuosity), but it feels a little forced. The mythological and nature imagery is strong and evocative, and I like the references to the Parca’s thread and the Aegean Sea. Some lines are beautifully translated, like "the thread can be easily thinned to the end," which is quite poetic. However, some phrases could be polished for smoother English flow, e.g., "the board of the trireme" might read better as "the side of the trireme." Overall, the feeling comes through, but a few tweaks could make the language more natural for English readers while keeping the original’s spirit. ... score: 0.31719

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I think these translations capture a vivid and intense atmosphere, which is really important for poetry like Olga Popova’s. The imagery of cicadas as Paganini-like musicians is quite striking and original, and it translates well into English. However, some phrases feel a bit awkward or overly literal, like “rub their wings off the Parca’s thread” — it might confuse readers unfamiliar with the Parca myth. Also, certain lines could benefit from smoother rhythm or more natural phrasing to flow better in English. Overall, the passion and wildness of the original come through, but a bit more polish could make it resonate even more with English speakers. ... score: 0.38744

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As an English speaker, I found the translation to be quite lyrical and evocative, but there were a few moments where the language felt slightly awkward or overly literal - for example, the phrase "in hazy times" could potentially be rephrased to something like "in a haze of nostalgia" to better capture the poetic essence of the original Russian text, and the use of "Parca's thread" is a bit unclear, as the reference to the Parca may not be immediately familiar to all readers, so it might be helpful to include a footnote or brief explanation to provide context for those who may not be well-versed in mythology, and I also appreciate the way the translator has maintained the musical quality of the original, with phrases like "They paganini, and scrub, and shriek" that have a lively, expressive feel to them, but some of the metaphors, such as the comparison of the sea to a lover, while beautiful, may feel a bit overused or clichéd to some readers, so it's worth considering whether there are other ways to convey the same emotions and ideas in a fresh and unexpected way. ... score: 0.3656

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: 1. I think the translations are quite captivating! The language used is vivid and evocative, creating strong imagery in the reader's mind. The use of metaphors and similes, such as "the chirping of cicadas" being likened to "paganini," and the sea being described as "wine-colored," adds depth and richness to the poems. However, some phrases may be a bit too literal or not entirely idiomatic in English, such as "the thread can be easily thinned to the end," which might sound a bit awkward to an English-speaking audience. Overall, though, I think these translations do a good job of conveying the beauty and emotion of the original Russian poems. ... score: 0.3453

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I absolutely love the vivid imagery and the musicality of these translations! The use of words like "paganini" and "bash" in the first stanza really captures the wild and almost chaotic energy of the cicadas. The alliteration in "polished are their fiddles" is a nice touch that adds to the rhythm. The second poem is equally captivating, especially the way it personifies the sea. The contrast between the sea's beauty and its dangerous, almost beastly nature is beautifully conveyed. The line "wine-colored, you swing in a tight embrace" is particularly evocative. I feel like I'm right there, experiencing the sea's fierce embrace. Overall, these translations are a great introduction to Olga Popova's work for an English-speaking audience. ... score: 0.40069

Post: Any bipolar writers out there? Fiction? Non-fiction? What's your routine?
Are there any other writers out there? How do you manage trying to keep a routine going along with the up and down cycles? I know for me since my diagnosis with Bipolar 2 keeping a routine has been easier in some ways but it's still a learning curve.   
  
I've been bouncing ideas for books in my head for years and have started more than a few times but the best I've done is get maybe 3 months into a novel and then, poof, things go ass over teacups.

Reddit author comment: Bipolar writer here. I've never finished writing a novel, but my poetry, journalism, opinion pieces, newspaper columns, and short stories are all published. I also do client work and used to teach sometimes. 

Writing is my day job. It doesn't pay well but I don't really have the proper skills and physical ability to do anything else. (I have some physical disability issues.) 

Personally I find the overly rigid routine approach to be anathema to my writing practice, and unrealistic for my life. However, as I get older I am more likely to get to bed around the same time at night even if it means stopping a writing streak, and take sleep meds, so that helps with lessening the bipolar episodes. Having kids helps too because they need routine: wake up for school, have family dinner somewhere in the 5:30-6:30 window, etc. ... score: 0.28368

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! Fellow bipolar writer here (Type 1) and I totally get the struggle. I've been writing fiction for about 8 years now and have completed three novels, though it took me forever to figure out a system that works with my brain chemistry. What I've learned is that rigid routines actually work against me - instead, I have flexible "anchor points" throughout my day. I always write first thing in the morning, even if it's just 50 words, because that's when my medication is most stable and my mind is clearest. During hypomanic episodes, I've learned to harness that energy but set strict limits - I'll write for 2-3 hours max and then force myself to stop and do something grounding like going for a walk. During depressive phases, I lower my expectations dramatically. Sometimes "writing" just means opening the document and reading what I wrote yesterday, or jotting down a single sentence. The key breakthrough for me was realizing that consistency doesn't mean doing the same amount every day - it means showing up in whatever capacity you can. Also, having a writing buddy who checks in weekly has been a game-changer for accountability without judgment. ... score: 0.30177

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey, fellow bipolar writer here (BP2 as well). I relate so much to your post! My writing routine has always been a moving target because my energy and focus swing so much between hypomania and depression. What’s helped me most is letting go of the idea that I need to write every single day or hit a word count. Instead, I make use of my “up” times to outline, brainstorm, or write drafts, and during “down” periods I’ll do smaller tasks like editing or research. I try to keep notebooks or Google Docs open so I can jot down ideas whenever they hit, even if I can’t act on them right away. Also, having a writing buddy or online group helps with accountability and motivation. Just remember, it’s okay if your process looks different—consistency isn’t always linear for us, but progress is progress! ... score: 0.31934

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey, fellow bipolar writer here! First off, I totally get what you mean about the routine being a double-edged sword. For me, having some structure is crucial, but I also have to be flexible because my mood swings can throw everything off. What’s helped is breaking my writing into really small chunks—like 15-20 minutes sessions—so when I’m hypomanic, I can ride that wave and write a lot, but when I’m down, I don’t feel overwhelmed trying to tackle huge chunks. I also keep a journal to track my moods alongside my writing progress, which helps me notice patterns and plan my “heavy writing” days accordingly. It’s definitely a balancing act, but honoring how your brain works instead of fighting it has made a huge difference for me. Have you tried anything like that? ... score: 0.27752

On good days, I might write more, but having that low baseline helps me stay consistent. I also find it helpful to keep a journal of my ideas and thoughts, so I don't lose track of them during the lows.

Post: I only have the "H" when I'm around other people
I never noticed any fidgeting until I read it in my evaluation.Now that is been pointed out,  I'm hyperaware that I can't sit still if anyone is focused on me. Zoom calls with my psychiatrist, I'm cleaning my room or snapping a hair clip. Interviews, I'm twirling my pencil under the camera. I can't stop. But if I'm alone, nothing. 
Is this just the anxiety? Is it hyperactivity? It's this common with everyone else?

Reddit author comment: I think that's an interesting way of thinking about it. My behaviorisms probably do get amplified around other people, but maybe that's because I'm nervous and 'stimming' more?  

But I always fidget. So much so that I sit in a rocking chair at my computer and do a lot of rocking when I'm alone.

The way the 'H' manifests for me when I'm alone is that whatever I'm doing, playing Minecraft, or tinkering in the garage, whatever it is, I look up and wonder why it is so dark in here and realize the sun has gone down, or I walk in the kitchen and I see cold toast in the toaster, cold coffee on the counter. The time blindness is absurd. ... score: 0.29774

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh wow, this is SO relatable! I experience the exact same thing and it took me forever to connect the dots. For me, it's definitely tied to social anxiety and feeling like I'm being observed or judged. When I'm alone, I can sit completely still for hours watching Netflix or reading, but the moment someone else is in the room - especially if they're looking at me - I become this fidgety mess. I'll start picking at my nails, bouncing my leg, playing with my hair, anything. My therapist explained that it's a pretty common manifestation of anxiety where your nervous energy needs an outlet. The hyperactivity component of ADHD often gets triggered by stress and social situations for a lot of people. You're definitely not alone in this! I've learned some grounding techniques that help, like holding something textured in my hands or doing subtle breathing exercises. It's frustrating when you feel like you can't control it, but understanding the trigger is actually a huge step forward. ... score: 0.28118

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally relate to this! I was diagnosed with ADHD last year, and I always thought "hyperactivity" meant physically bouncing off the walls 24/7. But for me, it's almost entirely situational—like you said, when people are watching or when I know I'm being evaluated. I think part of it is definitely anxiety, but my psychiatrist explained that for some people with ADHD, the hyperactivity can manifest as internal restlessness or just fidgeting behaviors, especially in social or high-pressure contexts. When I'm alone, I can zone out, hyperfocus, or just chill, but the second I'm on camera or with people, my leg starts bouncing or I start clicking a pen. So yes, it's common! You’re not alone. It might be a combo of anxiety and ADHD, and being self-aware of it now just makes it more noticeable. ... score: 0.38754

When I’m alone, I’m perfectly still and calm, but put me on a video call or in a room full of people, and I’m tapping my feet, playing with my pen, or just shifting around constantly. I’ve read that this kind of behavior can definitely be tied to anxiety—your brain is trying to burn off nervous energy. It might not be hyperactivity in the ADHD sense, but more of a coping mechanism to stay focused or calm down. You’re definitely not alone in this, and it’s actually pretty common! ... score: 0.29136

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I totally get what you're saying, and I can relate to the feeling of being hyperaware of your body language when you're in a situation where you're being observed. For me, it's not just about the physical fidgeting, but also the feeling of being "on" and performing for others. When I'm alone, I can just relax and be myself, but as soon as I'm around other people, I feel like I need to put on a show and be this perfect, polished version of myself. It's exhausting, and it's something that I've been working on with my therapist. I think it's definitely related to anxiety, and maybe even a bit of social anxiety, but it's also just a result of feeling like we need to present ourselves in a certain way to the world.

Post: How Do I Progress in Meditation After One Month?
Hey everyone,

I’ve been meditating daily for the past month (10 minutes a day) using Sam Harris’ Waking Up app. I’ve noticed subtle shifts in my perception and awareness, but I feel like I’m at a crossroads.

I know the obvious next step is to increase my meditation time, but beyond that, I don’t have a clear roadmap. I’ve seen posts saying “there’s nowhere to go, you’re already doing it,” and while I get that sentiment, I’d still appreciate some structured guidance on how to deepen my practice.

For those of you who’ve been meditating longer—how did you progress? What helped you move forward? Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks!

Reddit author comment: Hi... So i have never used any application or guided meditations....
The only guided thing I have done is YOG NiDRA.

Just narrating my experience with meditation.. please take what resonates and leave what doesn't..


I started sitting by myself.. and did get overwhelmed with the infinite number of thoughts running in my head... I started with just a few minutes... 

I did let all the thoughts come and didn't observe them ... But slowly the frequency and number of thoughts decreased... Now it was a bit possible to observe ..


Slowly the time increased and thoughts decreased...today I can sit for about an hour or let's say 40mins with very less thoughts...
And really good experiences ( which would be different for everyone)

So I would suggest to now ditch the application and see how much self sufficient you are for now... Slowly the next layer will unwrap itself to you...

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Congrats on sticking with it for a month! That's actually huge - most people don't make it past the first week. I've been meditating for about 3 years now, and I remember hitting that exact same crossroads around the one-month mark. Here's what helped me: First, definitely gradually increase your sit time, but do it slowly - maybe add 2-3 minutes every couple weeks until you hit 20-30 minutes. Second, start paying attention to your meditation outside of formal sitting. The real magic happens when you begin catching yourself throughout the day - noticing when you're lost in thought during conversations, or when you're eating mindlessly. I also started reading some dharma books around this time (Wherever You Go There You Are by Jon Kabat-Zinn was a game changer). The key is consistency over intensity. Don't worry about having profound experiences - those subtle shifts you mentioned are exactly what progress looks like in the beginning. ... score: 0.32726

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Great job sticking with a daily practice! That consistency is honestly the most important foundation. When I was at your stage, I started experimenting with different meditation techniques beyond just mindfulness. For example, I tried loving-kindness (metta) meditations, body scans, and even short open-awareness sessions. Each technique highlighted different aspects of my mind and gave me new insights. I also started reading books like “The Mind Illuminated” for a more structured, step-by-step approach. Over time, it really helped to journal after each session, noting what came up or shifted. You might also consider joining a local or online meditation group; sharing experiences and getting feedback can be surprisingly motivating and illuminating! ... score: 0.31536

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Awesome job on sticking to daily meditation! After a month, I’d say the next step is deepening your curiosity about your experience rather than just increasing time. Try to notice not just what you’re focusing on, but how you relate to distractions, emotions, or discomfort. Sometimes, practicing “noting” — gently labeling thoughts or feelings as they arise — can help develop meta-awareness. Also, exploring complementary practices like mindful movement (yoga, tai chi) or breathwork can enrich your experience. And don’t underestimate the value of community—forums, local groups, or online classes can keep you inspired and accountable. Keep it gentle and consistent! ... score: 0.34313

While it's great that you've been meditating daily for the past month, it's essential to remember that meditation is a journey, not a destination. Instead of increasing your meditation time, try to focus on increasing your mindfulness throughout the day. Pay attention to your thoughts, emotions, and physical sensations, and see if you can bring a sense of awareness and curiosity to your daily activities. This will help you cultivate a greater sense of presence and awareness, which will, in turn, deepen your meditation practice. Additionally, consider exploring different types of meditation, such as loving-kindness meditation or transcendental meditation, to see what resonates with you.

Post: Can meditation help me with my emotions?
I’m finding that I tend to over react and say things I should not, and whilst I think it would be better if I could simply shut off my emotions, I have heard that meditation can help me with controlling them, or letting them go so they don’t effect me. 

If this is possible I would like to know where to start. 

Reddit author comment: I can answer the first part of your question. Yes, meditation can help you to control your emotions. It will give you a sense of serenity and control that you will strive to keep, even when having strong pangs of emotions.
As for the second question, I'm sure someone else will give you more info. It's a personal journey, and what works for some may not work so well for others.
IMHO you begin finding a relaxing quiet place. You close your eyes and focus your attention on your breathing. How air gets in and slowly gets out. Others practice and repeat positive affirmations. 
For some meditation it's just a way to regain serenity and control, for others it's a spiritual experience.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Meditation has been a game-changer for me when it comes to emotional regulation. I used to be exactly like you - quick to anger, saying things I'd regret later, and just feeling overwhelmed by my emotions constantly. The key thing to understand is that meditation doesn't "shut off" your emotions (which isn't healthy anyway), but rather teaches you to observe them without immediately reacting. I'd recommend starting with mindfulness meditation - even just 10 minutes a day using apps like Headspace or Insight Timer. The practice teaches you to notice when emotions arise and creates a little space between the feeling and your reaction. That space is where the magic happens - it's where you can choose how to respond instead of just reacting automatically. It takes time and practice, but after about 6 months of consistent daily meditation, I noticed I was much calmer and more thoughtful in my responses to challenging situations. ... score: 0.48714

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, meditation can be a powerful tool for working with your emotions! It’s not so much about shutting them off, but more about noticing them as they arise and learning not to react automatically. When you meditate, especially with practices like mindfulness or loving-kindness meditation, you start to develop an awareness of your thoughts and feelings, almost like watching them from a distance. This can give you a pause before you react, and over time, that pause can help you choose your responses more consciously. I’d recommend starting with guided meditations—apps like Headspace, Calm, or even free ones on YouTube are a great entry point. Try starting with just 5-10 minutes a day and see how it goes.

I decided to pick it up again and this is the first time I am doing it on this medication, and my hand tremors affect my ability to create thin upstrokes. It doesn't affect my normal handwriting because I write quickly, but when I am trying to do something fine and slow, the tremors are very noticeable in the upstrokes. This medication is necessary and I don't know what to do. Has anyone else developed hand tremors/has hand tremors and found a way to do calligraphy? Or is this just no longer a viable hobby for me?

Reddit author comment: Embrace the squiggles. It makes it more human anyways. In this digital ai world. Signs of the human hand are more and more vital. Embrace the imperfections. Look into the Japanese term “Wabi sabi.” 

Also I’m pretty confident that you’ll improve the shakiness over time. Repetition and practice will do wonders. Maybe it’ll develop into your own style. 

Also, you don’t have to be a master at it to enjoy something as a hobby. As long as you derive joy from doing it, keep doing it. You got this! All the best with the medication, your body will adapt to it and the symptoms won’t be as pronounced. ... score: 0.36713

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I'm so sorry you're going through this - I completely understand how devastating it must feel to have something you love affected by medication side effects. I've dealt with essential tremor for years, and while it's not medication-induced, I've found some techniques that might help you. First, try practicing your calligraphy when your tremor is at its mildest - for many people, this is earlier in the day or after light exercise. You can also experiment with different pen weights; sometimes a slightly heavier pen can provide more stability. Consider trying brush pens or markers instead of traditional nibs, as they're more forgiving with slight variations in pressure and movement. Also, don't give up on the hobby entirely - you might need to adapt your style rather than abandon it. Some calligraphers have embraced a more organic, flowing style that actually incorporates natural hand variations beautifully. ... score: 0.318

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey OP, I really feel for you—I'm on a medication that causes tremors too, and it’s frustrating when it impacts something you love. I’m not into calligraphy, but I knit and noticed the tremors most when working slowly or with finer needles. What helped me was working with slightly larger tools and adapting my expectations of what “perfection” means for me now. For calligraphy, maybe you could try broader nibs or even brush pens that are more forgiving with pressure? Also, stabilizing your arm by resting it on the table can help reduce tremors. It might take experimentation, but don’t give up just yet! ... score: 0.28654

I also developed hand tremors from medication, and it really threw a wrench into my fine motor hobbies like painting and drawing. What helped me was experimenting with different tools—sometimes switching to a brush pen or a slightly thicker nib can mask the tremors a bit. Also, try working on calligraphy exercises that emphasize broader strokes or more fluid motions rather than tiny detailed upstrokes. It’s not the same style, but it still allows you to enjoy the art form. Lastly, have you talked to your doctor about the tremors? Sometimes they can adjust dosages or suggest alternatives. ... score: 0.36367

I can imagine how frustrating it must be, especially since calligraphy is a hobby that requires precision and control. It's great that you've decided to pick it up again, but I understand that the tremors are making it difficult for you to achieve the desired results. Have you considered talking to your doctor about the side effects of your medication? Perhaps there are other options or alternative treatments that could help minimize the tremors. Additionally, you could try experimenting with different tools or techniques that might be more forgiving, such as using a thicker nib or practicing with a brush pen.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I can totally relate to how you're feeling. I had a similar issue with a medication I was on, and it was really tough to adjust. One thing that helped me was to take frequent breaks. I would work for 10-15 minutes and then rest for a few minutes. This helped reduce the tremors a bit. I also started practicing with larger nibs, which are more forgiving and can help mask the tremors. It's not the same as the delicate work you're used to, but it can still be beautiful. I hope you find a way to keep doing what you love! ... score: 0.30279

Post: How do you guys write without feeling like you're being fake/performative?
My friends got me a journal for my birthday and I wanted to start writing in it. But I've always found it really hard to write down my thoughts without feeling like I'm being pretentious or like my thoughts aren't good enough to be written down anywhere. 

It feels so self indulgent that it makes me uncomfortable to allow myself to write freely. I feel like I'm being narcissistic? I don't know if I'm explaining it well but it's like  in my head I just keep hearing "who do you think you are, writing down you're feelings? Who cares? You don't, so why" and i know it's good to write stuff out but it's so difficult to get out of my own head and not feel like I'm being performative with my writing. 
I just feel this weird imposter syndrome kinda thing? Is any of this even really me? Or am I writing it for the sake of writing it? Ugh 

When I see how easy it is for some people to just let their words go, I feel so much envy. All the words inside me just refuse to be expressed, and if they are I just end up feeling so embarassed of them and like something is wrong with me. I immediately want to throw it away cause seeing my thoughts outside my own head feels so unnatural.

If any of you have tips or suggestions for how I can get over this or even just any advice for how to do this whole thing, I'd be really grateful. What do you write? Are there prompts you follow? Are there methods I can use to write more freely? Any and all help appreciated, thank you 😭💚

Reddit author comment: The only person judging you and telling you that your words are not real is you. But this is normal in an age where everything real is fake and everything fake is real. You are not the first person to feel like an imposter or that your words have no value. But I will tell you the truth. Your words do matter. 

A journal is a mirror. You can use your words to reflect any aspect of yourself. And starting off, you will feel like an imposter because writing has not been a skill you have developed yet. The only way to cut through the crap you are smothering yourself in is to write and write and write until you find your genuine voice. ... score: 0.28599

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh my god, I feel this SO hard. I went through the exact same thing when I started journaling about three years ago. That voice in your head telling you "who do you think you are" is basically your inner critic on steroids, and it's absolutely brutal when you're trying to be vulnerable on paper. What helped me was starting with the most mundane, boring stuff possible - like literally writing "I had cereal for breakfast and it was okay I guess." No deep thoughts, no profound insights, just documenting the most basic parts of my day. It took the pressure off completely because there's nothing pretentious about writing down that you brushed your teeth or watched Netflix. After a few weeks of that, I naturally started adding little observations or feelings, and before I knew it, I was writing more freely. The key is removing the expectation that your journal needs to be meaningful or important. It's just for you, and you deserve to take up space, even on paper. ... score: 0.22034

Sometimes I even start with “No one will ever read this” at the top of the page, just to reinforce the privacy. Another tip: try freewriting for 5-10 minutes without stopping, even if what you’re writing is “I don’t know what to write, this is dumb.” Eventually, your brain will get bored of being self-critical and start letting stuff out. Prompts can help too—there are tons online, but even simple ones like “What did I notice today?” or “What’s one thing I’m grateful for?” can get you started without feeling too deep or fake.

What helped me was shifting the mindset from “writing to be read or judged” to “writing as a private conversation with myself.” I remind myself that no one else needs to see this, so I can be as raw, messy, or unpolished as I want. Sometimes I even start entries with “this is just a brain dump” to take off the pressure of making it sound good or meaningful. Also, giving myself permission to write utter nonsense or silly stuff helped me loosen up and realize that the act of writing itself is what matters—not the content’s quality.

For me, what helped was to just start writing, without thinking too much about it, and to remind myself that it's okay to write badly or to write things that don't make sense. I mean, it's not like you're trying to publish a novel or anything, it's just for you, and it's okay if it's not perfect. I also found it helpful to write about really mundane things, like what I had for breakfast or what the weather is like, just to get into the habit of writing without feeling like I need to be profound or insightful. And yeah, prompts can be helpful too - I like to use writing prompts from books or online, just to get started and to give myself some direction.

Morning journaling works great for me when I want to set intentions for the day, do brain dumps of random thoughts cluttering my mind, or work through anxiety before it builds up. I usually do like 10-15 minutes with my coffee before checking my phone. Evening journaling is better for reflection - processing what happened during the day, gratitude practice, or working through emotions that came up. I find it helps me sleep better because I'm not lying in bed ruminating. Right now I do a hybrid approach where I do quick morning pages (just stream of consciousness writing) and then more structured reflection in the evening.

Post: Saw Sonny Boy And...I'm Not Sure How I Feel About It
The show was definitely interesting with its characters and bizarre setting, but that ending...just kinda left this empty feeling inside me. I don't think I felt this way since "Angel Beats". 

Also can someone explain how Nozami "died" in episode 10? Like why couldn't Asakaze use his power right there!? I was so confused!

Reddit author comment: I wasn’t a huge fan of Sonny Boy personally. I respect what it was going for, but it just felt kind of “hollow”, for lack of a better term. While I think the ideas it was trying to tackle were interesting, once you “get” that this is all just a metaphor for the confusion of growing up and entering the wider world you realize that there really isn’t much else to it. The story, world and characters are all incredibly vague and ill defined, and while this may be intentional, it still leads to it being difficult to give much of a shit about any of the characters or anything that happens. 

Finally, the ending was just incredibly unsatisfying in my opinion. The defense of this is  usually “it was supposed to be unsatisfying”. Thing is though, something being intentionally unsatisfying doesn’t change the fact that it was unsatisfying. I feel like they could have expressed the same theme without it feeling so half assed and unfinished. ... score: 0.33574

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally get that empty feeling you're describing! Sonny Boy is one of those shows that deliberately leaves you with more questions than answers, and I think that's intentional on Natsume's part. The ending isn't meant to provide closure in the traditional sense - it's more about the bittersweet nature of growing up and how we all eventually have to leave our "islands" behind. As for Nozomi's death, I interpreted it as her power finally consuming her completely. Throughout the series, we see hints that using abilities comes with a cost, and Nozomi had been pushing herself to her limits. Asakaze couldn't save her because by that point, she had already made her choice to sacrifice herself. His power has limitations too - he can't just reverse any death, especially when it's tied to someone's power/essence like that. The show is definitely more about the emotional journey than the mechanical explanations of how things work. ... score: 0.31758

That empty feeling you mention is something a lot of viewers felt, myself included. It’s kind of similar to "Angel Beats" in that it’s more about the journey and the emotions rather than tying everything up in a neat bow. As for Nozomi in episode 10, it’s a bit tricky. From what I understood, her "death" wasn’t a typical physical death—it’s more like she lost her "possibility" to continue existing in that world. Asakaze couldn’t save her because, at that point, the rules of the world had shifted and his power wasn’t absolute anymore. The show plays a lot with the idea that some things are just out of your control, no matter how much power you think you have.

It’s one of those shows that doesn’t give you neat, wrapped-up answers and instead leaves a lot of things open to interpretation, which can definitely leave you feeling empty or even frustrated. The surreal vibe throughout the series builds up this strange atmosphere where reality feels fluid, and then the ending kind of doubles down on that. I think the point was more about the characters’ emotional journeys and how they cope with isolation and change rather than delivering a traditional plot resolution. As for Nozami’s “death,” I interpreted it as a metaphorical or existential kind of death rather than a physical one.

I felt the same way after finishing it, and I think it's because the show does a great job of making you invest in the characters and their struggles. The world they're in is so unique and fascinating, and the way the story unfolds is both captivating and unsettling at the same time. I think the reason why you're feeling empty is because the show doesn't give you a clear resolution or a traditional happy ending, which can be frustrating for some viewers. As for Nozami's "death" in episode 10, I think it's because Asakaze's power has its limitations, and it's not something that can be used to bring people back from the dead. The show does a good job of explaining the rules of the world and the characters' abilities, but sometimes it's easy to get confused.

I think the show was trying to leave things open to interpretation, but it just didn't land for me. As for Nozami's "death," it's a bit of a plot twist.

Post: Has anyone had any luck treating OCD with only meds and no therapy?
I've started taking an SSRI for my OCD and anxiety a few months ago, but I am extremely hesitant to go to therapy. I am honestly, incredibly hesitant to share my compulsions, anxiety and thoughts with other people. I don't even know how I would begin to even explain my problems to a psychiatrist/therapist. 

I'm really hoping there are some people here who've had luck significantly reducing their symptoms without therapy. I don't expect to completely get rid of my OCD, but just to manage the symptoms.

My compulsions decreased, but some days were still really tough, especially when I was stressed. From what my psychiatrist told me, meds can definitely help manage symptoms, and some people find that’s enough for their daily functioning. But therapy (especially ERP) is considered the gold standard because it teaches you coping skills and helps you face the fears behind the compulsions. That said, it’s totally your choice, and you shouldn’t feel pressured. Maybe see how you do on meds for a while, and if you hit a plateau, you can always reconsider therapy in the future.

In terms of the antidepressant that your psychiatrist may have recommended it may have been for a few other reasons than them simply thinking you are depressed. Some of those medications help to reduce or regulate cortisol (the stress hormone) release that is associated with PTSD. ADHD also fucks up the release or transfer of dopamine to certain parts of your brain which can leave people feeling depressed .

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Holy shit, yes! I thought I was losing my mind until I started researching the connection between PTSD and memory issues. It's actually super common - trauma literally rewires how our brains store and retrieve memories. The hippocampus (which handles memory formation) gets all messed up when we're in chronic fight-or-flight mode. I have the same thing where I'll randomly remember something from like 5 years ago while I can't remember what I had for breakfast. It's not just the "bad" memories either - it's like my brain just decided to file everything in the wrong cabinet. Have you looked into EMDR therapy? It's specifically designed for PTSD and some people say it helps with the memory fog too. Also, if you have ADHD on top of PTSD, that's like a double whammy for memory issues. Maybe try pushing back on the antidepressant thing and ask specifically about PTSD-focused treatments? Your brain isn't broken, it's just trying to protect you in a really inconvenient way. ... score: 0.48134

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, you’re not alone. Memory issues can be a huge part of both ADHD and CPTSD, and it’s super frustrating when people (especially professionals) brush it off or try to treat it as depression. I relate a lot to what you’re saying—sometimes I’ll forget what I did yesterday, or I’ll be in a conversation and suddenly a random memory from years ago will hit me out of nowhere. It’s not that I’m not paying attention, it’s just like my brain is on a delay or has huge gaps. I read somewhere that the stress from PTSD can impact how your brain stores and retrieves memories, and ADHD makes it even harder to keep things in the short-term “working memory.” It sucks that psychiatrists just want to throw antidepressants at you instead of actually addressing what you’re describing.

It’s really common for people with chronic PTSD to experience memory disruptions, not just with traumatic events but with everyday stuff too. The brain sometimes prioritizes or suppresses certain memories as a coping mechanism, which can make it feel like you’re losing chunks of time or details. It sucks that your psychiatrists keep pushing antidepressants when you don’t feel depressed—sometimes it takes finding someone who specializes in trauma or ADHD to get a treatment plan that addresses your specific struggles, like therapy focused on trauma processing or even ADHD coaching.

Post: Where does this invisible pressure for perfectionism in our journaling practice come from?
Hello r/Journaling  👋 

I recently asked about [hurdles in journaling](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1j47vnv/question_for_those_of_you_with_a_solid_journaling/) and one to the top answers was overcoming perfectionism. Now that I am attuned to it, I can't unsee it. It's [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1j4x4zb/buying_many_journals_because_you_want_to_pour_out/), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Journaling/comments/1j4s83j/journaling_is_downright_scary_change_my_mind/), and on the backdrop of many other threads.

* I am really curious, where does this idea of your journal having to be perfect come from? 
* Secondly, what does perfection mean to you? Can someone point me to this elusive journal perfection (if it exists?)

As usual sub, thank you!

Reddit author comment: There seems to be something in the human brain where we see someone being "good at" something and it puts us into immediate "I could never do that/have never tried to do that and that somehow reflects poorly on me" mode. 

I see it in adult coloring groups, too. People will share a beautiful piece they just finished and half the comments are these poor-me "Oh, I could never be this good and it makes me want to throw all my supplies away and quit" comments. Like that is neither uplifting to the person who posted nor helpful to yourself.

I broke my journaling perfectionism by getting a journal I didn't care about that much and giving myself permission to ruin it. It was very, very useful. I recommend it.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I think the perfectionism comes from a few places honestly. First, social media has totally warped our perception of what journaling "should" look like. Instagram and Pinterest are flooded with these gorgeous bullet journals with perfect handwriting, elaborate spreads, and artistic doodles that look like they belong in a museum. When you see that stuff constantly, it's hard not to feel like your messy, stream-of-consciousness scribbles don't measure up. Second, I think there's this cultural thing where we're taught that anything worth doing is worth doing "right" - but journaling isn't homework or a performance, it's supposed to be personal. For me, perfectionism means wanting every entry to be profound, my handwriting to be consistent, and never making spelling mistakes or crossing things out. It's ridiculous when I think about it logically, but that pressure is still there lurking in the background every time I pick up my pen. ... score: 0.32421

Over time, that becomes the default “journal” image in our heads, even though most people’s journals are messy, private, and imperfect.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I think a lot of the pressure for perfectionism in journaling comes from the broader cultural emphasis on productivity and achievement. We live in a world where social media often showcases only the polished, highlight-reel moments of people's lives, and journaling can sometimes feel like another opportunity to present a “perfect” version of ourselves—even if it’s just on paper. So instead of viewing a journal as a safe space for messy thoughts and feelings, it becomes a project that needs to be neat, coherent, and meaningful. To me, perfection in journaling feels like an unattainable myth because our minds aren’t linear or flawless.

This mindset can be particularly damaging when it comes to creative pursuits like journaling, where the goal is supposed to be self-expression and personal growth, not perfection. I've noticed that many people, including myself, feel like they need to have a perfect journal, with beautiful handwriting, colorful decorations, and profound insights.

Post: Buttercup (The Princess Bride/Book v Movie)
I was looking over The Princess Bride. The first time I'd read it, I felt like the movie didn't stray too far from the book, but this time I couldn't help but notice how much of Buttercup's background and character arc are completely cut from the movie.

**Gone from the movie:** *her parents, her distain from being girly and making herself pretty to attract boys, her difficulty trying to live a normal life when people keep putting her on a pedestal, her realization that she needs to put Westley and her family before her own needs.* 

All of that's just from the first chapter!

I felt like movie Buttercup is portrayed as a selfish woman, and while she does suffer in the film, nothing she experiences really changes her personality. She stays selfish right up until the ending credits. 

Am I crazy? Did you get a different impression of Buttercup from the movie versus the book? Let me know!

Reddit author comment: Buttercup of the novel is also kind of a ditzy airhead, and the movie removes that entirely, to the character’s benefit.  

For the most part I like the movie version of that story much better.  But there are some interesting character elements that get left behind, or are only glancingly referenced.  For example, there’s an interesting theme running through the novel where characters all think one very specific thing about themselves, and are almost always *wrong*.  Humperdinck thinks he’s brave; really he’s a coward.  Vizzini believes he’s the smartest man alive; is wrong about everything.  Fezzik thinks himself stupid, and while he has a simple view of the world, he’s almost unerringly right about everything.  Inigo believes he’s useless at planning—so he sets out a step by step, intricate plan to rescue the man in black from the most dangerous place in the kingdom, so that the man in black can make the plan that will get him into the castle on his revenge quest. ... score: 0.34981

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're absolutely not crazy! This is one of the most glaring differences between the book and movie, and it's honestly my biggest gripe with the film adaptation (though I still love it). Book Buttercup has so much more depth and agency - she's actively struggling with her identity, her relationships, and her place in the world. The movie strips away all of that internal conflict and character development, leaving us with what essentially amounts to a beautiful damsel in distress. I think the filmmakers were so focused on the adventure and romance elements that they forgot Buttercup needed to be a fully realized character too. The book shows her grappling with expectations, trying to figure out how to be true to herself while also caring for others, and actually growing as a person. Movie Buttercup just... exists to be rescued and to look pretty while Westley does all the heavy lifting. It's such a shame because Robin Wright is a fantastic actress who could have absolutely nailed the more complex version of the character if given the material to work with. ... score: 0.34655

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally agree with you. The first time I saw the movie, I thought Buttercup was just a standard damsel-in-distress: she's pretty, she's there to be rescued, and she mostly just reacts to what happens around her. After reading the book, though, I was shocked at how much depth was missing from her character onscreen. In the book, you actually get to see her grow and change, dealing with her insecurities and the way people objectify her. She has a real arc about learning what matters and who she is, which is almost completely erased in the film. I think the movie wanted to keep things light and fast-paced, but in the process, they flattened Buttercup into a more passive character who never really gets a chance to shine or evolve. It's a shame, because her journey in the book adds a lot of nuance to the story. ... score: 0.28632

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally agree with you! The book dives so much deeper into Buttercup’s character and really humanizes her in ways the movie just glosses over. In the novel, you get this sense that she’s struggling against the expectations placed on her, and that internal conflict makes her a lot more relatable and complex. The movie, while iconic, kind of simplifies her down to the classic damsel in distress trope, which doesn’t do justice to her growth or the emotional nuances that Goldman wrote. It’s interesting how cutting those details changes our perception of her from a flawed but evolving person to just a static character.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who's read the book and seen the movie multiple times, I must say that your observation about Buttercup's character arc is spot on. The movie does leave out a significant amount of her background and development, which makes her come across as somewhat one-dimensional and selfish. In the book, her struggles to navigate her feelings and her place in the world are much more nuanced and relatable. For instance, her disdain for the societal expectations placed on her as a woman, particularly in terms of beauty and marriage, is a major theme in the book. This is evident in her initial reluctance to take care of her appearance and her frustration with being treated like a prize to be won. The movie, on the other hand, glosses over these complexities and reduces her character to a more simplistic, damsel-in-distress trope. I think it's interesting that you mention her realization that she needs to put Westley and her family before her own needs, because this is a crucial aspect of her growth as a character. In the book, she comes to understand that her love for Westley is not just a romantic feeling, but also a deep-seated commitment to prioritizing his well-being and happiness above her own desires. This is something that's largely absent from the movie, where her love for Westley is portrayed more as a passionate, all-consuming emotion rather than a thoughtful, selfless choice. ... score: 0.31631

It's a shame because the book really delves into her growth and the internal conflicts she faces, especially when it comes to her relationship with Westley and her family.

Post: How are your pregnancy hormones affecting you emotionally / mentally?
Currently 20 weeks, and throughout pregnancy I've noticed my hormones will sometimes amp up for a day or two and have some strange effects. Yesterday, for example, I spent most of the day feeling like I was looking at the world through a distorted fun house mirror. Everything felt sinister, scary, sad, etc. Even my husband felt like a stranger in my own house and I couldn't look at him too long or else it freaked me out. I knew it was hormones and felt a bit better after taking my focus off how I felt and just doing practical things to take care of myself, but it was super uncomfortable. I have a therapist and am no stranger to navigating mental health challenges, but days like yesterday make me nervous for the PP period. 

Today, I feel totally back to normal, and the day before yesterday, I was super happy and content despite dealing with a cold. The emotional whiplash is truly something.

Post: Separation anxiety training
We recently adopted a 7 month old English Cocker Spaniel cross. She's very intelligent and sweet, but came from a neglected background and was abandoned at the foster where we got her from. I've been with her at home for the last 2 weeks and she's settled in really well, bonded to my partner and I, sleeps through the night, accidents in the house/puppy pad use has dropped almost entirely, eats well, goes on walks. She's a little skittish and nervous around new people, but she's come along way even in the \~2.5 weeks we've had her.

On Monday, I tried going in to the office for the first time. We have baby cameras in the house to monitor her. When I checked on her about 30 minutes after I left, I could hear she was vocalising a lot and she had torn up the puppy pad we had left down for her. I came home after about 3 hours from leaving. She stopped vocalising around the hour and a half mark, and she was just sleeping on the bed afterward. When I got home, she wasn't visibly excited or racing to come greet me, just lying on the bed and her head perked up to look at me. Both my partner and I don't make a big fuss about leaving and returning from work, a calm acknowledgment when she's settled.

Since then, I've been doing some desensitisation training on me leaving the house to help with the separation anxiety behaviour. I'll "get ready to leave", put her behind the puppy gate, and call out "I'll be back", and then stand outside the front door and monitor her on the camera. Initially, I came back in when I could see her on the bed sitting or lying down and not scratching at the gate or vocalising and give her a high value treat, calmy telling her she's a good girl, and repeating the process. We've been repeating this training over 40ish minute blocks since Tuesday, and she's quickly picked up that being on the bed calmly gets her a reward. If she jumps down to run to the gate when I come back in, I turn around and start again. She also has a Kong toy she only gets when we go out.

She'll jump up and down off the bed a couple times looking for us, vocalise and scratch at the gate, but she will always get back on the bed and sit/lie down calmly after doing so. I've pushed this to about 5-7 minutes, mindful to not go too long too quickly.

Is there anything else I should be doing to help reinforce the behaviour, or at this point is the consistency the key?

Reddit author comment: Sounds like you are doing everything right! Consistency is key. Also acknowledge that it can take 3+ months for a dog to settle in and get used to a routine. She’s also about to go through a fear period and almost a teenager (yikes) so if you have setbacks it doesn’t necessarily mean you are doing something wrong, they just tend to take 2 steps forward 1 step back at this age.

As someone who went through this exact same situation with my rescue pup, I can tell you that consistency is definitely the key here, and it sounds like you're already seeing great progress. The fact that she's learned that being calm on the bed gets rewarded shows how smart she is and how well your training approach is working. One thing I'd suggest adding is gradually increasing the unpredictability of your departures - sometimes leave for 2 minutes, sometimes 6, sometimes 4, so she doesn't start anticipating exactly when you'll return. Also, consider adding some mental stimulation toys beyond just the Kong - puzzle feeders or snuffle mats can help keep her brain occupied and make alone time more positive. Given her background of neglect and abandonment, you're being incredibly thoughtful about taking this slowly. The progress you've described in just a few days is honestly impressive.

Consistency is definitely key, but you might also want to consider varying your departure cues a bit so she doesn’t get too accustomed to a specific routine—sometimes dogs can start associating certain actions (like picking up keys or putting on shoes) with you leaving, which can trigger anxiety. Also, try mixing up the time you’re gone, sometimes shorter, sometimes a little longer, but always within her comfort zone. Interactive toys like puzzle feeders or treat-dispensing balls can help too, so she has more to focus on than just your absence. Finally, if you haven’t already, try to make sure she’s had some physical exercise and mental stimulation before you leave—tired dogs are generally less anxious.

One thing you might consider adding to your training is a "departure cue" - a specific action or phrase that signals to your dog that you're leaving, which can help her prepare and reduce anxiety. This could be something as simple as putting on your jacket or grabbing your keys, and using a specific phrase like "I'm going out" or "see you later." By associating this cue with your departure, you can help your dog learn to anticipate and cope with your leaving. Additionally, you might consider increasing the duration of your departures gradually, but also randomly, to simulate the unpredictability of real-life situations. For example, you could start with shorter departures, like 5-10 minutes, and then increase the duration to 30 minutes, but also throw in some shorter departures to keep your dog on her toes. ... score: 0.40983

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I'm so glad to hear you're taking such a thoughtful and patient approach with your new pup! It's amazing how far she's come in such a short time, especially given her background. The desensitization training you're doing is spot-on for helping her with separation anxiety. I would suggest adding some classical conditioning to the mix as well. You can start by pairing your leaving with something really positive, like her favorite treat or a long-lasting chew toy. This can help her associate your departure with good things, not just the absence of you. You might also try leaving the house for very short periods initially, like 30 seconds, and gradually increasing the time as she becomes more comfortable. It's great that you're using a Kong toy as a distraction, but you could also try giving her a frozen Kong or a food puzzle toy to keep her engaged and mentally stimulated while you're away. Consistency is definitely key, but these small adjustments can help reinforce the positive behavior even more. Keep up the great work, and I'm sure she'll continue to make amazing progress! 🐾💪 ... score: 0.37857

Post: Now What 
Ok so, I've simplified my life. 

Now, I have so much free time. It's kind crazy. I work 25-30 hours a week, nights. So I have every day completely open. No kids, no pets, and - I live in my van. 

I'm working with my therapist on ADHD stuff and wondering if this is contributing to my issue. I don't have a ton of motivation to do anything/can't find much that piques my interest enough to pursue it. 

What do you do with all of your free time and do you ever feel like you have too much time on your hands?

I can spiral, by not doing much - become lethargic, feeling sedentary and then like the day has gotten away from me. It's not good on my mental health. 



Reddit author comment: I totally understand this. I spent many years working part time or in jobs that didn't take me all the hours I was employed. I now have a job that is very flexible but in person a lot and tends to take me the full 40 hours a week of quite demanding work - and I do think I am mentally better off for it.

It's so hard to figure out what this means. I hate thinking we have to be "productive" at all times, and I want people to work less and have more time for other things. And I hate that life circumstances mean I don't have the time to do the stuff I want like exercise. But actually the years I had no caring responsibilities and only worked 20 hour weeks I also didn't do all those things I "wanted" such as art, exercise, enriching things....I just stewed and felt miserable. And maybe its because I'm conditioned to only operate in certain ways. But I really do wonder if it is undiagnosed ADHD and having too much free time leaves me in a cycle of not doing much and then feeling bad about myself.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally get this feeling! I went through something similar when I first got diagnosed with ADHD - having too much unstructured time can actually be paralyzing rather than freeing. What helped me was creating what I call "soft structure" - not rigid schedules, but loose frameworks for my days. I started with tiny habits: morning coffee while reading for 20 minutes, a short walk at the same time each day, or picking one small project to focus on for just an hour. The key was making them small enough that I couldn't fail. Also, since you're living the van life, have you considered slow travel? Like staying in an area for a week or two and really exploring it? The novelty might help with the ADHD brain's need for stimulation. And honestly, volunteering has been a game-changer for me - it gives purpose, structure, and social interaction all in one.

Post: How to stop intellectualizing?
Hi! I'm looking for some advice and to see if anyone has struggled with intellectualizing too much while journaling. I am way more of a thinker than a feeler. I use logic to make sense of my feelings and experiences - I am working on this more and more. One way that  helps is journaling out my feelings and thoughts, but I find that they sound too logical and thought out when I go back and read my entries. I find that when I sit down to journal, I'm thinking out what I want to write first, and I believe in this process I'm not showing up as authentically as I'd like to on paper. I'm not sure if this makes sense or is relatable, I'd love to hear any thoughts or advice you might have for someone looking to crack open a bit more <3 

Reddit author comment: Have you tried free writing? Set a timer for 5 minutes. Once the timer starts, you cannot stop writing until it finishes.  No editing, no erasing, you just write whatever comes into your head for that entire time.  It'll probably be a mess of "crap I don't know what to write why am I doing this this sucks omg this is awful my brain is completely blank wtf" and so on for at least the first few lines but eventually most people do hit a stride. As you do it more, the thoughts start to come a bit more clearly but without the self-editing almost all of us do out of habit.

If you're feeling like 5 minutes is too short, go for 10.  Too long?  Try 3.  The time doesn't matter as much as putting pen/pencil to paper and not letting yourself stop long enough to think.  Some people set a theme (I often try to free write specifically about whatever story/plot point I'm stuck on) but you do have to be careful there because it's easy to feel guilty if you go off-theme--which is almost guaranteed to happen.  Most people's thoughts aren't especially linear, letting yourself get off track is part of the point. ... score: 0.38813

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh my god, this is SO relatable! I'm a chronic over-thinker and used to have the exact same problem with journaling. What really helped me was setting a timer for 10-15 minutes and doing "stream of consciousness" writing - literally just writing whatever comes to mind without stopping, even if it's "I don't know what to write" over and over. The key is to not lift your pen from the paper (or stop typing) no matter what. It forces you to bypass that analytical filter in your brain. Also, try writing with your non-dominant hand sometimes - it sounds weird but it actually slows down your thinking process and connects you more to raw emotion. Another trick I learned is to start entries with "Right now I feel..." and then just let whatever comes up flow out. Don't worry about it making sense or being "good" writing. The messier and more scattered it is, the more authentic it probably is. You're already aware of the pattern, which is huge - that self-awareness will help you catch yourself when you start intellectualizing. ... score: 0.30073

No editing, no re-reading while writing, just a stream of consciousness.

It forces you to just get words out without overanalyzing them. Another approach is to try free writing first, then go back and reflect on what you wrote later.

I also try to focus on my physical sensations and emotions, like how my body is feeling, what emotions am I experiencing, and what memories are coming up for me, rather than just thinking about them logically. It's not always easy, but with practice, I've found that I'm able to tap into my feelings more and write from a more authentic place.

Post: Quality of language in modern books vs classics?
I'll preface this by saying I quite enjoy reading both classic and modern literature, so I don't think I hold any particular bias. I've recently been reading mainly modern novels (books written within the last decade or so) but tonight I decided to dip into some Edgar Allan Poe and it got me thinking: the language of classic works seems  so much richer than the language used in more recent novels. What happened? Even going back as recently as the 1950's/60's, the words seem to have more texture and diversity. I love coming across words I don't know while I'm reading and having to look them up, but that doesn't often happen with modern novels. I know this probably has a lot to do with the sort of language I've  had more exposure to growing up etc, but I feel like the general pool of words seems to have shrunk over the years. Has anyone else noticed this? It seems a shame and I'm starting to worry that there may be an overall trend towards the simplification of language. 

Reddit author comment: A few things. That might give this impression.

1.  Older literature has had time to settle.  Meaning that over time we have kept and read really good works of writing and discarded a lot of less impressive stuff.  It's possible the writing that has been selected as literately important is more complex.  So you might be comparing less important contemporary writing to older but more refined selections.
2.  Literacy has changed dramatically since the 19th century.  Pretty much 99% of people in the US can read and literacy has spiked internationally.  This wasn't always the case.  This meant that only wealthy]well educated people could afford to learn to read and produce writing.  Thus writing was often fancier and more diverse because typically those able to be writers had the wealth to be educated and the sophistication that came with that education.  Contemporary art is open to more people, and its tone reflect this.  I don't personally think that it means writing is worse, but maybe it just cuts against your taste?
3.  The perspective on what "counts" as writing and literature has certainly become less formal over time (maybe related to the above issues).  People like Faulkner and Joyce really demonstrated that capturing a less formal tone could still be literately worthy and complex.

Maybe some of these things are what you're picking up on.  I wouldn't worry too much about language degrading.  Language shifts and changes and always evolves to match the needs of its writers.  Cheers ... score: 0.36098

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've definitely noticed this too, and I think there are several factors at play here. First, the publishing industry has become much more commercialized since the mid-20th century. Publishers are often looking for books that will appeal to the widest possible audience, which means favoring more accessible language over ornate prose. There's also the influence of digital media and shorter attention spans - many readers today are used to consuming information quickly, so dense, vocabulary-rich writing might feel sluggish to modern audiences. Additionally, writing styles have generally moved toward what's called "transparent prose" - the idea that language should be a clear window to the story rather than drawing attention to itself. Authors like Hemingway really pioneered this approach. That said, I don't think rich language has disappeared entirely - you just have to know where to look. Authors like Cormac McCarthy, Donna Tartt, and Kazuo Ishiguro still craft beautiful, complex prose. It might be that we're comparing the very best classics (which have survived precisely because of their exceptional quality) to average contemporary works. ... score: 0.32109

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I’ve noticed this trend as well, and it’s something I’ve thought about a lot as a reader and writer. Part of it, I think, has to do with the way our culture has shifted towards valuing immediacy and accessibility. Modern novels are often written with the idea of being “unputdownable” and easy to consume, so the language is streamlined to keep the plot moving. Publishers might even encourage simpler language to reach a wider audience, including non-native speakers. On the other hand, classics like Poe were written for a readership that often had a classical education, so writers could assume familiarity with more complex vocabulary and literary allusions. I agree it’s a bit sad—we lose some of that delight in discovering new words or savoring a particularly well-crafted sentence. That said, there are still modern writers who play with language in interesting ways; they’re just a little harder to find in the mainstream. Maybe this is a call for us to seek out and champion those books! ... score: 0.32372

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from. Classic literature often feels like it was written with a very deliberate and ornate style, which can make the language seem richer or more textured. Part of that is because of the time period and the audience those works were intended for—reading was one of the main forms of entertainment, so authors sometimes indulged in more elaborate vocabulary and sentence structures. Modern novels, on the other hand, often aim for accessibility and pace, especially with changing reading habits and the rise of digital media. This doesn’t necessarily mean the language is worse, just different. There are still plenty of modern authors who play with language masterfully (think of writers like Zadie Smith or Colson Whitehead), but the overall trend does seem to favor clarity and immediacy over complexity. Also, the shrinking vocabulary you mentioned might be influenced by how our communication styles have evolved; with texting, social media, and fast-paced lifestyles, we tend to favor simpler and more direct language. That said, I think both styles have their place, and it’s great you enjoy both! ... score: 0.25564

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think that's a valid observation, and one that's been on my mind lately too. As someone who's studied linguistics, I can tell you that language is constantly evolving, and the way we use words is heavily influenced by our culture and environment. In the past, literature was often written with the intention of showcasing the author's knowledge and mastery of language, whereas today, the focus is more on telling a compelling story and conveying emotions. This shift in priorities has led to a more straightforward and accessible writing style, which can sometimes come across as simpler or less nuanced. However, it's also important to recognize that this shift has made literature more inclusive and diverse, allowing a wider range of voices to be heard. I think it's not necessarily a bad thing that language has become more streamlined, as it's allowed authors to focus on the core of their message rather than getting bogged down in elaborate vocabulary. That being said, I do appreciate the beauty of complex language and the way it can add depth and richness to a narrative. Perhaps the key is finding a balance between accessibility and artistry, allowing authors to craft stories that are both engaging and linguistically rich. ... score: 0.3497

Post: Is Naofumi trying to make everyone hate him and if so why? (The Rising of the Shield Hero)
Hi all, I just finished episode 8 and in that episode Raphtalia asked if Naofumi was trying to make everyone hate him. I might've forgotten something but is that true and what would the point be or is he actually just kinda mean?

Reddit author comment: I only read the webnovel, and the anime is based off of the light novels which almost completely diverge after book 2, but I'm pretty sure they're the same in season 1 so the answer I remember is 'No'. He's not trying to get people to hate him. He just doesn't care what people think about him because he assumes they already hate him or would otherwise treat him poorly/exploit him.

But I read this like a decade ago, so I might not remember the nuances.

Yeah Naofumi is kinda mean but it's a result of his immense ptsd/depression. Idk if they conveyed that clearly in the anime but in the webnovel it's pretty clear. iirc he can't even taste anymore ever since his trauma. ... score: 0.36961

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yeah, Naofumi is definitely putting up walls and pushing people away, but it's not because he's naturally mean - it's a trauma response from being falsely accused and betrayed so early on. Think about it: he was summoned to save the world, immediately framed for rape, stripped of his money and reputation, and abandoned by literally everyone except slave traders. That kind of betrayal would mess anyone up psychologically. He's adopted this cynical, abrasive persona as a defense mechanism because if he expects the worst from people and keeps them at arm's length, he can't be hurt again. It's easier to be the "bad guy" than to risk opening up and getting stabbed in the back again. Raphtalia sees through this facade because she's been with him long enough to witness his genuine kindness beneath the bitter exterior. He saved her, cared for her when she was sick, and protected her despite claiming he only sees her as a tool. The guy is clearly hurting and using meanness as armor. ... score: 0.34302

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a great question and a pretty central theme to Naofumi’s character, especially in the early part of the show. It’s not that Naofumi is *trying* to make everyone hate him, but after being falsely accused and seeing how the kingdom immediately turned on him, he’s basically given up on trying to win people over. He adopts this “lone wolf” persona as a defense mechanism because he feels like he can’t trust anyone except Raphtalia. So, when he acts cold or indifferent, it’s more about protecting himself from further betrayal. It might look like he’s purposely pushing people away, but it’s really just a reaction to the trauma and injustice he’s faced. Over time, you’ll see that his attitude starts to change as he slowly rebuilds trust, mostly thanks to Raphtalia and others who genuinely care about him. ... score: 0.35405

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I don’t think Naofumi is actively trying to make everyone hate him, but given the circumstances he’s in, it kind of comes off that way sometimes. Remember, he was falsely accused and betrayed right at the start, so he’s naturally guarded and defensive. He’s not mean for the sake of being mean; it’s more like self-preservation and mistrust. He’s been forced into a corner where he can’t rely on others, so his bluntness and sometimes cold attitude are a way to protect himself from further harm. Raphtalia’s question might be more about how his behavior appears to others rather than his true intentions. Naofumi’s actions are shaped by trauma, and while he might not be the most socially graceful hero, he’s genuinely trying to survive and get stronger to protect those who trust him. So, no, he’s not trying to make everyone hate him—he just hasn’t had much of a chance to show his good side yet. ... score: 0.42267

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think Naofumi is trying to make everyone hate him, at least to some extent. I believe he's doing this as a form of self-protection, given the betrayal and abuse he suffered at the hands of Malty and the rest of the nobles. It's like he's putting up walls around himself, making it difficult for others to get close, so he doesn't get hurt again. This behavior could also be a result of his past experiences, where being nice and trusting led to him being taken advantage of. By being perceived as mean or standoffish, Naofumi may be trying to deter people from getting too close, thus avoiding the risk of being betrayed or hurt once more. Moreover, his actions could be a cry for help, a desperate attempt to get someone to notice him and understand his pain, even if it's through negative attention. It's also possible that Naofumi is struggling with feelings of guilt and shame, stemming from the false accusations and his subsequent treatment, which could be contributing to his behavior. Overall, I think Naofumi's actions are complex and multifaceted, driven by a mix of self-protection, past trauma, and a deep-seated need for connection and understanding. ... score: 0.32269

Post: Anyone else find it extremely rare to genuinely like a person?
In my 20 years of life, I can count the number of friends I've genuinely liked on one hand. Most of my friends? I just want someone to hang out with for a while to pass the time, I don't really care too much about them as individuals beyond that. 

But there are three people I actually like, and I always feel so surprised when this happens. "Wow, I think this person is great and I actually respect them."

It always takes me over a year to warm up to someone enough to reach that point as well, my level of attachment is very low for the first year or so and I'm constantly skeptical that the friendship will actually last. 

Is this normal or am I just a really closed off person?

Reddit author comment: I think you might be a little bit closed off to be honest. That isn't necessarily negative though.  I don't think that falls outside of the scope of what is considered normal. Some people form attachments earlier while others need more time to do so.  What matters is that we are aware of how we function ourselves. 

As I have gotten older, I have developed a better sense of what characteristics I like in other people and what characteristics I don't.  I have become more forgiving and more flexible. I realize that no human is without flaws and that each and every person that I love or like (as well as myself) does have shadow sides that aren't all that flattering.

But I've come to realize that maybe I just have higher standards for what constitutes a real friendship. The people I do genuinely like, I would do anything for - and that means something. I'd rather have a few authentic connections than a bunch of surface-level friendships where I'm just going through the motions. ... score: 0.41699

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Honestly, I think this is more normal than most people admit. There’s a difference between being friendly and genuinely connecting with someone. I have plenty of acquaintances and “friends” I hang out with, but very few people I truly like and respect on a deeper level. It’s not necessarily about being closed off; it’s just that real compatibility and genuine admiration are rare. It’s like dating—most people you meet aren’t going to be your soulmate. I also take a long time to feel attached, and often wonder if a friendship will last. So, I wouldn’t worry too much. Quality over quantity! ... score: 0.37619

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally get where you're coming from. I've always found it hard to genuinely connect with people beyond surface-level friendships. Like you, I often have "acquaintance friends" who are great for hanging out or passing time, but when it comes to truly liking someone on a deeper level, that’s much rarer. I think it takes time to build trust and see someone's true character, so the fact that it takes you over a year to warm up doesn’t seem unusual at all. Honestly, I don't think being a bit closed off is a bad thing—it might just mean you value quality over quantity in friendships, which is a good trait. ... score: 0.31964

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've noticed this phenomenon too, and I think it's because we're living in a world where social connections are so superficial, it's hard to find people who genuinely share our values and interests. I mean, think about it, most of our interactions are online, and even when we meet people in person, it's often in a group setting or at a loud event where it's hard to have meaningful conversations. I've found that the people I've formed deep connections with are those I've met through shared activities or hobbies, where we can bond over something specific and have time to get to know each other on a deeper level. It's not that we're closed off, it's just that we're not giving ourselves the opportunity to form meaningful relationships, and when we do, it's a rare and precious thing. I've been trying to make a conscious effort to seek out these kinds of connections, whether it's through joining a book club or volunteering for a cause I care about, and it's been amazing to see how much more fulfilling my relationships have become. ... score: 0.37146

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: 1. I can totally relate to this! I've always been selective about who I let into my life, and I think that's perfectly okay. It's important to surround ourselves with people who bring out the best in us and who we genuinely enjoy spending time with. Don't be too hard on yourself for being "closed off" - it just means you know your ... score: 0.41263

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: It's so refreshing to hear someone else say this. I think it's a sign of emotional maturity to be selective about who you let into your life. I have a few close friends and a lot of acquaintances, and I'm okay with that. It's about quality over quantity, and it's important to have people in your life who you genuinely respect and care about. It takes time to build those kinds of connections, and that's okay. To me, it's better to have a few deep, meaningful friendships than a bunch of surface-level ones. I think you're doing the right thing by taking your time and being selective. To me, it's a sign of strength and emotional intelligence. I'm glad you've found a few people you genuinely like and respect. It's a beautiful thing when you find those connections. I think you're just being thoughtful and intentional about your relationships, and that's a good thing. ... score: 0.39418
