Post: Last classes were today and students added me on social media
Today was the last day of classes and 2 of my favorite students requested to follow me on Instagram. Completely great and mature kids and I want to accept the requests, but I feel like the smart move is to wait till they graduate (they just finished 9th grade). Any advice on how to handle this? This is my first year of teaching and haven't handled this so far. 

Reddit author comment: You could take my approach and just not have social media. I've gotten rid of my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, and can't say my life is noticeably worse for having done so; Facebook is nice to find out what happened to the people wmyoi went to high school with, but then you eventually realize why you weren't friends with everyone, anyway. Plus, these companies make money on any data you give them, data which compromises your personal privacy, lets companies engage in differential pricing and marketing, and has the power to sway elections (at least, if we believe the social research that's trickling out, now).

So, to my mind, the easiest answer to them asking is "I don't have it, here's why," because you not only answer the question in a way they can't wheedle in, but start a conversation about an important issue they probably never thought of.

I might give out my email address, if they're seniors, but that's it. ... score: 0.27854

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Honestly, your instinct to wait is spot on. I've been teaching for 8 years now and this comes up every semester. Even with your absolute favorite, most mature students, it's just better to maintain that professional boundary while they're still enrolled at your school. Social media can get messy - you might see posts about parties, drama between students, or even just typical teenage stuff that could put you in an awkward position later. What I usually do is tell students something like "I'd love to connect after you graduate! Hit me up then and we can follow each other." Most kids totally understand and respect that boundary. The mature ones especially get it. Plus, if admin ever questions your social media connections with current students, you don't want to have to explain yourself even if your intentions are completely innocent. Wait until graduation - it shows professionalism and protects both you and them. ... score: 0.42923

gpt4.1-instruct comment: As a fellow teacher, I totally get where you’re coming from! It feels really flattering when students want to connect with you outside of school, especially the ones you’ve built a good rapport with. However, I would strongly recommend holding off on accepting their requests until after they graduate. Even if they’re mature, there are still professional boundaries to consider, and school policies (and parents!) can get really particular about this kind of thing. What I usually do is politely let students know that I don’t accept current students on my personal social media, but once they graduate, I’d be happy to connect. This keeps things professional and sets a good example. Plus, you never know what might happen in the future, so it’s best to err on the side of caution. Great job making it through your first year! ... score: 0.50028

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Honestly, I think you’re right to be cautious here. It’s always a tricky line between being approachable and maintaining professional boundaries, especially as a teacher. Accepting social media requests from current students can sometimes blur those lines and might lead to uncomfortable situations down the road. Waiting until they graduate is a good move because it helps keep your relationship strictly professional while they’re still under your authority. In the meantime, you can always keep the connection positive in class and encourage them to reach out through school channels if they ever need help. Once they’ve graduated, if you’re comfortable, accepting the follow requests can be a nice way to keep in touch without the complications. It’s great that you’re thinking about this so carefully—setting clear boundaries early on will serve you well throughout your career. ... score: 0.42078

Post: Roddick Agreeing with Opelka about doubles
So this was from the lastest podcast episode of Roddick's Served Podcast. I have to say Roddick's general attitude regarding doubles is a bit over the top. I dont know what his problem is regardless of it making money or not but he just comes off as belittling doubles players and acting like how Opelka says that they are failed singles players.

Roddick in his podcasts tends to just shit on doubles to no end. For him its just a money suck. Even with that nice feel good win of patten and heliovaara he went and shit on it. Even i the recent podcast he keeps harping on doubles being a money suck when I genuinely dont see it. He also seems to hate the fact that doubles specialists exists and also agrees with Reilly that doubles players are just failed singles players or ones who never tried at singles. (Also as aside note love how he's fine with all the shit that Reilly posts cause 'he's just being himself' but needs to find a way to critique other players who post shit on social media

Roddick in this podcast episode really has me turning off from him cause of the way he is talking. Watching it today it was just like "if you dont agree with me then your just an emotional loser who doesnt understand the realities of money and life'. But like doubles has been here for a while it makes money when the tournaments promote it properly IMO. Heliovaara and Patten winning was such a nice thing imo given the sturggle they had to make it into tennis. Maybe Roddick's been blessed in that he's never had that issue of financial struggle and its clearly showing especially wiht the Bopanna comments.

Overall very preachy and over the top.

EDIT: He's really doubling down on it with short he released pretty much saying anyone who disagrees with him is just being emotional. What i am seeing is just a retired player using a podcast as is little soapbox and not actually providing any value here. For all the facts he says he actually hasnt provided any aside from Doubles has been here for a while. He hasnt said how much the tours or slams spend to promote doubles.

Reddit author comment: None of them explained why they don’t want double specialists, just that they don’t. Apparently a player said they have no problem with Bopanna, just that they don’t want another one, why? It just screams jealousy. The singles players complain about scheduling enough, now they’re all gonna start playing doubles? Give me a break.

Something I don’t really ever see considered is the cost to go watch tennis, I was looking recently at tickets for Turin, Stuttgart and Vienna, Turin was at least €200 for half a day of the first RR, Vienna was €100 for some R1 seats and Stuttgart was about €130 for a weekend grounds pass. It’s insane, I got day 1 centre court Wimbledon tickets last year for £70, but tour events charge more, so if people are just attending one event a year that’s cost a lot they probably do want to see a big name they know and can tell people about. Someone I know took his mum to the USO and he got to watch Swiatek and had no idea who she was, what hope do double players have? ... score: 0.30258

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Honestly, I've been noticing this pattern with Roddick for a while now and it's really disappointing. The guy was an incredible singles player and I have massive respect for what he accomplished, but his takes on doubles are just straight up disrespectful. Like, does he not realize that some of the greatest tennis minds in history were doubles specialists? The Bryan Brothers revolutionized the game and brought so much excitement to doubles tennis. And the argument that they're "failed singles players" is just lazy analysis. Some players genuinely prefer the strategy and teamwork aspect of doubles - it's a completely different skill set. Roddick seems to think that because he found success in singles, that's the only "legitimate" path in tennis. It's giving major boomer energy tbh. The fact that he doubled down with that short just shows he's not interested in having an actual discussion about it. ... score: 0.32118

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally agree with your take on Roddick's attitude toward doubles. Honestly, it feels like he has some personal grudge or at least a chip on his shoulder about the format. I get that singles is the marquee event and where the big money and attention go, but to constantly dismiss doubles as just a "money suck" seems incredibly tone-deaf. Doubles brings a different set of skills to the table—reflexes, teamwork, strategy—that singles simply doesn't highlight in the same way. And for a lot of fans, the excitement and unpredictability of doubles is a huge draw. I also think it’s unfair to call doubles players “failed singles players”; some people just excel in a different discipline, and that should be celebrated, not mocked. Roddick’s podcasts used to be insightful, but lately, it’s like he’s just trying to stir the pot for engagement. ... score: 0.33081

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I get where you’re coming from with Roddick’s attitude on doubles—it does feel unnecessarily harsh and dismissive at times. Doubles is a distinct discipline with its own strategies, skills, and fanbase, and to reduce it to just “failed singles players” is pretty disrespectful. Not every player who specializes in doubles is someone who couldn’t cut it in singles; some choose doubles because they genuinely enjoy the format or have skill sets that shine more in that environment. Plus, doubles adds a lot of excitement and variety to tournaments, and players like Heliovaara and Patten have compelling stories that inspire fans. Roddick’s approach feels like he’s using his platform to belittle rather than educate, which is disappointing. ... score: 0.35475

As someone who's been following tennis for years, I think it's unfair to belittle doubles players and view them as failed singles players. The skillset and strategy required to excel in doubles are entirely different from singles, and it's not as simple as just being a "failed" singles player. I also find it interesting that Roddick tends to focus on the financial aspect of doubles, but doesn't provide any concrete evidence or data to support his claims.

I get that he's coming from a singles player's perspective, but it's frustrating when he doesn't acknowledge the unique challenges and strategies involved in doubles.

Post: Memory loss
Anyone else in here at can’t remember shit? I can’t remember short term or long term. Sometimes things will come to me days after. Sometimes it’s literally years before a random memory pops up. Not all trauma memories just simple stuff too. I also have ADHD but all my psychiatrist try to give me anti depressants. I’m not depressed I just got chronic ptsd and my memory is funky. 

Reddit author comment: For sure. My focus and short term memory are not great. Part of it is that I have a very busy life, I have 2 young kids etc etc. I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD and am primarily inattentive type (more classically thought of as ADD), and treating that has made a difference in my focus which I find helps me remember better, but I completely understand where you are coming from.

In terms of the antidepressant that your psychiatrist may have recommended it may have been for a few other reasons than them simply thinking you are depressed. Some of those medications help to reduce or regulate cortisol (the stress hormone) release that is associated with PTSD. ADHD also fucks up the release or transfer of dopamine to certain parts of your brain which can leave people feeling depressed . I AM NOT medically trained and I don't know almost anything about the technical side of medications. My mother is a retired pharmacist and has explained some of this in these terms, as well as the Nurse Practitioner who diagnosed my ADHD, just trying to offer some potential insight as to why that may have been a suggested course of action. ... score: 0.32898

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Holy shit, yes! I thought I was losing my mind until I started researching the connection between PTSD and memory issues. It's actually super common - trauma literally rewires how our brains store and retrieve memories. The hippocampus (which handles memory formation) gets all messed up when we're in chronic fight-or-flight mode. I have the same thing where I'll randomly remember something from like 5 years ago while I can't remember what I had for breakfast. It's not just the "bad" memories either - it's like my brain just decided to file everything in the wrong cabinet. Have you looked into EMDR therapy? It's specifically designed for PTSD and some people say it helps with the memory fog too. Also, if you have ADHD on top of PTSD, that's like a double whammy for memory issues. Maybe try pushing back on the antidepressant thing and ask specifically about PTSD-focused treatments?

It’s not that I’m not paying attention, it’s just like my brain is on a delay or has huge gaps. I read somewhere that the stress from PTSD can impact how your brain stores and retrieves memories, and ADHD makes it even harder to keep things in the short-term “working memory.” It sucks that psychiatrists just want to throw antidepressants at you instead of actually addressing what you’re describing.

Post: grieving my pre-ocd self
i know i technically was never a pre-ocd version of myself, but it was minor for most of my life but worsened very quickly and severely when i was 18 (20 now). my ocd is based around contamination and i think about when i was able to do things that i now deem gross, like touching doorknobs, using another person's pencils or class supplies, tying my shoes.. just wondering if there is anyone else whose ocd developed a bit "later" and can relate

Used to smoke weed a lot and now I’d rather die than take the smallest baby toke.

Now I look back at photos of myself casually eating food at restaurants, touching public surfaces without a second thought, or sharing drinks with friends and it feels like watching a different person entirely. There's this weird grief that comes with it - mourning a version of yourself that felt more carefree and spontaneous. I think what makes it harder is that we have these vivid memories of being able to do things that now feel impossible, which can make the contrast feel even more stark. It's important to remember that recovery is possible though, and many people do get back to doing things they once enjoyed.

Post: Question for Boston sports folks: does anyone sincerely and unironically enjoy listening to 98.5 The Sports Hub?
I’ve been thinking about this for a while now. I’ve given that station a try here and there, but every show and hosts I’ll hear is just plain hard to listen to - just bottom of the barrel kind of radio with major douchebag energy, jackass hosts with try-hard and cringey shows that are grating to the ears, real offputting je nais se quoi to their brand, and pretty embarrassing for New Englanders overall. 

I understand ‘hate-listening’ and the whole hot takes industry which they definitely lean into get listeners, but I’m real curious and need to know if there are people out there that genuinely enjoy and prefer 98.5’s content? And why? 

There has to be or else they would’ve folded to WEEI by now. The difference in quality, content, personalities etc there is crazy even with non-sports just bullshitting kind of stuff - they’re excellent. So I can’t figure out how someone would ever listen to Sports Hub. 



Reddit author comment: I stopped listening to 98.5 mornings when Rich  left and it was clear that he was the creative force and he had all the funny and clever bits. Fred is just a self-aggrandizing narcissist who's so full of himself and creepy I can't even stand it. I do actually listen to felger and mazz  frequently and I do enjoy them. I understand why people don't like them because they are kind of contrarians for radio but I find it entertaining and they have reasonable takes and aren't afraid to criticize the home teams. They're very knowledgeable as well and often have Insider information. I think their football and hockey talk is the best though. Feel like baseball turn into Mazda 6 to 7:00 show but it doesn't get talked about much on the show. Their basketball talk is their weakest Forte and I usually don't listen to it for that reason but the rest of it I do enjoy.

Look, I get why people think some of the hosts come off as douchey - Felger and Mazz especially can be grating with their contrarian takes and the whole "everything sucks" attitude. But here's the thing: they're not wrong a lot of the time, and they actually do their homework. When they rip apart a Patriots game plan or call out the Celtics for lazy defense, they usually have the receipts. I think what people mistake for "douchebag energy" is just them not sugarcoating things for fans who want to hear that everything is awesome all the time. Toucher and Rich in the morning can be juvenile, sure, but they're also genuinely funny when they're on, and their chemistry is pretty solid.

Post: How do you organise plastic food containers?
I would like to get a discussion going about how to organise plastic food containers.

What have you tried that didn't work? Why?

What have you tried that does work? What is great about this way of storing plastic containers?

What is your tip for keeping plastic food containers organised?

Reddit author comment: I think the reason you don't have more responses is that there aren't very good methods.  Those things are a mess.


I was successful, if limited, for about five years:  we bought the ["Spin-n-Store" set](http://www.anzbigstore.com/image/cache/catalog/as%20seen%20on%20tv/49pcs%20Smart%20Spin%20n%20Store%20Tupperware%20Blue-228x228.jpg), as seen on T.V.     It worked good.  We used it enough we had to buy a second set to replace lost/cooked-out pieces.

But I finally got tired of the sets limitations.... They store great in the fridge because of their shape, but it seems like you never have enough of the medium and large containers, and they're not very pack-a-lunch friendly because of their shape.

So we reverted back to regular, out-of-the-grocery variations of generic tupperware.  What a mess.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, this is such a relatable struggle! I've tried SO many different methods over the years. What absolutely didn't work for me was stacking containers inside each other without any system - it created this nightmare avalanche situation where I'd have to pull out 15 containers just to find the right size, and then the lids would be scattered everywhere. I also tried those fancy drawer dividers, but they were too rigid and couldn't accommodate different container shapes. What finally worked was dedicating one deep drawer to containers and storing them upright like files, with lids stored separately in a shallow basket on top. I can see everything at a glance, grab what I need without disturbing others, and the lids are easily accessible. My biggest tip is to ruthlessly declutter - throw away any containers without matching lids, and donate extras. Having fewer containers makes any organization system actually sustainable long-term! ... score: 0.40848

gpt4.1-instruct comment: One thing that has really worked for me is dedicating a specific deep drawer just for plastic food containers and their lids. I used to keep everything in a cupboard, but the containers would constantly avalanche out or get lost in the back. Now, I nest the same-sized containers together and use a large, shallow basket just for the lids, sorted by size and shape. The biggest change was making a rule that I never put a container away unless its matching lid is present. This way, I never end up with a bunch of lidless containers or vice versa. I also do a quarterly purge, donating or recycling any mismatched or damaged pieces. The drawer system makes it really easy to see what I have and keeps the mess to a minimum! ... score: 0.44654

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I used to just stack all my plastic containers in one big pile, which quickly became a nightmare because lids would get lost or mismatched, and it was impossible to find the right size when I needed it. That method definitely did not work for me. What finally helped was using a dedicated drawer organizer with adjustable dividers. I separate lids and containers, stacking containers by size nested inside each other and then placing the lids vertically in a separate section. This keeps everything visible and easy to access, plus it prevents the lids from getting damaged. My biggest tip is to always keep lids and containers paired as much as possible, and if you don’t have a matching lid, consider donating or recycling that container to reduce clutter. Also, labeling shelves or sections can speed up clean-up and keep the system consistent for everyone in the household. ... score: 0.45632

I bought some clear storage bins from the dollar store and separated the containers by size. I keep the lids in a separate bin and use a lid organizer that I got from Amazon. It has slots for different sizes, and it keeps everything in order. I also label each bin with the size of the containers inside, so I can quickly find what I need. This system has been a game-changer for me. No more lost lids or scratched containers!

Post: Do I have to apologize for wanting more?
I didn't put context because it's a general question... Regardless of the situation, we always make decisions looking for something better for our lives. It's not about unrealistic expectations, but about choosing what really makes sense to me.

But, inevitably, any choice we make can affect someone, even indirectly. And sometimes that makes me feel guilty...

So, is wanting more – in the sense of seeking the best for my life – something I should apologize for?

Reddit author comment: Forgive me if this is overreaching, but were you a 'broken cookie kid'? When adults handed out snacks, you would offer to take 'the broken cookie'/the smaller portion or as an adult you take the bad end of whatever deal you're presented because you feel social value from being the one who 'takes one for the team'?

Maybe that's a stretch, but it's something I heard a while back and it stuck with me.... Maybe moreso to you specifically; It's okay to have wants, it's okay to have needs, and while generally good to you look out for others, you neglect basic care for yourself, and shun rewards for 'just doing your job' in some regard. 

Not every decision that results in a positive for you means a negative for others. If it does, it's because of a broken system that you're just a small player in. You can continue to make decisions to help others, but you can do that more effectively if you're well taken care of first.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely not, you shouldn't apologize for wanting more in life. The guilt you're feeling is actually pretty normal - it shows you're a considerate person who thinks about how your choices affect others. But here's the thing: you can't live your life making decisions based solely on avoiding potential harm to others, because that's impossible. Every choice creates ripple effects, and that's just part of being human in an interconnected world. What matters is that you're making thoughtful decisions, not reckless ones. You can pursue what's best for you while still being mindful of others - it's not an either/or situation. The key is finding that balance between self-advocacy and empathy. Your life is yours to live, and wanting to improve it, grow, and seek fulfillment isn't selfish - it's human nature.

Post: Saw Sonny Boy And...I'm Not Sure How I Feel About It
The show was definitely interesting with its characters and bizarre setting, but that ending...just kinda left this empty feeling inside me. I don't think I felt this way since "Angel Beats". 

Also can someone explain how Nozami "died" in episode 10? Like why couldn't Asakaze use his power right there!? I was so confused!

Reddit author comment: I wasn’t a huge fan of Sonny Boy personally. I respect what it was going for, but it just felt kind of “hollow”, for lack of a better term. While I think the ideas it was trying to tackle were interesting, once you “get” that this is all just a metaphor for the confusion of growing up and entering the wider world you realize that there really isn’t much else to it. The story, world and characters are all incredibly vague and ill defined, and while this may be intentional, it still leads to it being difficult to give much of a shit about any of the characters or anything that happens. 

Finally, the ending was just incredibly unsatisfying in my opinion. The defense of this is  usually “it was supposed to be unsatisfying”. Thing is though, something being intentionally unsatisfying doesn’t change the fact that it was unsatisfying. I feel like they could have expressed the same theme without it feeling so half assed and unfinished. ... score: 0.33391

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I totally get that empty feeling you're describing! Sonny Boy is one of those shows that deliberately leaves you with more questions than answers, and I think that's intentional on Natsume's part. The ending isn't meant to provide closure in the traditional sense - it's more about the bittersweet nature of growing up and how we all eventually have to leave our "islands" behind. As for Nozomi's death, I interpreted it as her power finally consuming her completely. Throughout the series, we see hints that using abilities comes with a cost, and Nozomi had been pushing herself to her limits. Asakaze couldn't save her because by that point, she had already made her choice to sacrifice herself. His power has limitations too - he can't just reverse any death, especially when it's tied to someone's power/essence like that. The show is definitely more about the emotional journey than the mechanical explanations of how things work. ... score: 0.3871

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from. Sonny Boy is one of those shows that feels intentionally ambiguous, and the ending in particular is super open to interpretation. That empty feeling you mention is something a lot of viewers felt, myself included. It’s kind of similar to "Angel Beats" in that it’s more about the journey and the emotions rather than tying everything up in a neat bow. As for Nozomi in episode 10, it’s a bit tricky. From what I understood, her "death" wasn’t a typical physical death—it’s more like she lost her "possibility" to continue existing in that world. Asakaze couldn’t save her because, at that point, the rules of the world had shifted and his power wasn’t absolute anymore. The show plays a lot with the idea that some things are just out of your control, no matter how much power you think you have. It’s frustrating, but also kind of beautiful in its own way. ... score: 0.394

The surreal vibe throughout the series builds up this strange atmosphere where reality feels fluid, and then the ending kind of doubles down on that. I think the point was more about the characters’ emotional journeys and how they cope with isolation and change rather than delivering a traditional plot resolution. As for Nozami’s “death,” I interpreted it as a metaphorical or existential kind of death rather than a physical one. Asakaze’s powers might have limits tied to emotional or mental states rather than just being able to reverse anything on command.

The world they're in is so unique and fascinating, and the way the story unfolds is both captivating and unsettling at the same time. I think the reason why you're feeling empty is because the show doesn't give you a clear resolution or a traditional happy ending, which can be frustrating for some viewers. As for Nozami's "death" in episode 10, I think it's because Asakaze's power has its limitations, and it's not something that can be used to bring people back from the dead. The show does a good job of explaining the rules of the world and the characters' abilities, but sometimes it's easy to get confused.

I think the show was trying to leave things open to interpretation, but it just didn't land for me. As for Nozami's "death," it's a bit of a plot twist. Asakaze's power is limited by his own emotional state and the bonds he shares with others. In that moment, he was overwhelmed by his own grief and the weight of the situation, which might have hindered his ability to use his power effectively.

Post: Did I see what I thought I saw on Amazon Prime?
For the first time ever, I have Amazon Prime.  I took the 30 days free in order to buy a few discounted things on the Prime Days.

So I ordered a number of things on sale and when I ordered on thing, the shipping comes up with options.  IIRC, it had like 3 options and they were all free.  One of them offered me a $1 reward if I waited about 10 days.  Then it said I would be saving boxes (or something) if I went with the 3 or 4 day option.  I went with the fastest free option.

Here's the thing that gets me, they charge you quite a bit extra to get fast shipping when you don't have Prime, but now it looks like they don't want me to take advantage of the fast shipping when I DO HAVE PRIME.

It's like they want to screw me with high shipping costs, then ask nicely if I'll just take the slower shipping for no reason other than saving them a buck.

----------

Also, the show on Prime are not all free.  I browsed around and even OLD SHOWS can costs a few buck per episode.

Gotta say that I'm a bit surprised and disappointed.

Reddit author comment: We own a business that we run from home and generally have somewhere in the ballpark of 40 packages delivered from Amazon per week. It’s actually much simpler for us to get them all on one day of the week so we can be sure someone is home and so we can dedicate part of that day to getting everything where it needs to go. 

I often choose this option for non-business items as well. Say I buy a coffee pot and filters to go with it. I can’t use one without the other, so I’ll just have them shipped on the same day, even though it’s the later date. 

Finally, ordering everything to arrive on one day *does* greatly reduce packaging, which is important if you have as many packages coming as us (we’d have to pay to have the boxes hauled away if everything came individually wrapped), or even if you’re just a bit environmentally conscious. 

Instead of being annoyed by it, consider that not everyone has the same needs as you, and choose the option that works best for you. ... score: 0.28415

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You've basically discovered Amazon's entire business model in one post! The shipping thing is absolutely by design - they want you to pay for Prime membership, then once you have it, they try to nudge you away from using the expensive fast shipping that you technically paid for. That $1 credit is their way of saying "please don't cost us money on shipping." It's pretty brilliant from a business perspective but feels scammy as a customer. The box consolidation thing is their environmental guilt-trip angle, but really it's about reducing their logistics costs. As for Prime Video, yeah, it's basically a loss leader to get you hooked on the ecosystem. The "free" content is mostly older stuff or their originals, while anything remotely current or popular costs extra.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Yeah, you saw it right. Amazon has been doing this for a while now. When you have Prime, you get the “free” fast shipping, but they also offer the option to delay your shipment in exchange for a small digital credit (usually $1), which you can use for things like Kindle books or digital videos. What they’re really doing is incentivizing you to help them consolidate shipments and reduce their shipping costs. It’s a win-win for them: if you take the credit, they save on logistics; if you go for fast shipping, you feel like you’re getting your money’s worth from Prime. The thing about not all shows being free is also true.

Post: Winter weather for Portland no longer predicted by major weather models
There was a post a few days back warning of a distant chance of winter weather, but no significant plunge in temperatures is in the long-range forecast anymore for next 30 days, into mid-February, meaning we could have an essentially winterless winter, although late freezes are always possible.

KOIN's [Josh Cozart](https://www.youtube.com/@joshcozartwx) also has a YouTube channel, Mark Nelsen has his [blog](https://www.kptv.com/weather/blog/), and the KPTV weather team has a [podcast](https://www.kptv.com/podcasts/weather/).

My heating bill is definitely thanking whatever climate patterns are keeping us mild. But on the other hand, this feels really wrong for February in the Pacific Northwest. I've lived here for over 20 years and while our winters were never Minnesota-brutal, we usually got at least a few proper cold snaps and maybe some snow in the gorge.

I've been following Rod Hill's YouTube channel and I found his video explaining the situation in a layman-friendly way to be really helpful, he has a way of breaking down complex weather information into easy-to-understand terms. I've also been checking out Josh Cozart's channel, and I appreciate the effort he puts into providing detailed forecasts and insights. I've been trying to find other sources of Portland weather information that go beyond the typical maps and apps, and I stumbled upon Mark Nelsen's blog, which has been a great resource. I've also been listening to the KPTV weather team's podcast, which offers a unique perspective on the weather. I'm glad to have these resources available, and I'm looking forward to a mild winter. On a separate note, I did notice that when searching for KPTV on YouTube, the first videos that come up are from the KPTV News channel in Myanmar, which I found to be quite confusing, I'm not sure why that is, but it's definitely something to be aware of when searching for local weather information. ... score: 0.39609

Post: Anyone else find it extremely rare to genuinely like a person?
In my 20 years of life, I can count the number of friends I've genuinely liked on one hand. Most of my friends? I just want someone to hang out with for a while to pass the time, I don't really care too much about them as individuals beyond that. 

But there are three people I actually like, and I always feel so surprised when this happens. "Wow, I think this person is great and I actually respect them."

It always takes me over a year to warm up to someone enough to reach that point as well, my level of attachment is very low for the first year or so and I'm constantly skeptical that the friendship will actually last. 

Is this normal or am I just a really closed off person?

Reddit author comment: I think you might be a little bit closed off to be honest. That isn't necessarily negative though.  I don't think that falls outside of the scope of what is considered normal. Some people form attachments earlier while others need more time to do so.  What matters is that we are aware of how we function ourselves. 

As I have gotten older, I have developed a better sense of what characteristics I like in other people and what characteristics I don't.  I have become more forgiving and more flexible. I realize that no human is without flaws and that each and every person that I love or like (as well as myself) does have shadow sides that aren't all that flattering.  

There isn't a single human being that I genuinely like every single aspect of. Everybody is flawed in some way. But there are plenty of people whom I genuinely like despite their flaws. ... score: 0.29762

I'm 28 now and I've noticed that as I've gotten older, I've become way more selective about who I invest emotional energy in. Like you, I have maybe 3-4 people I genuinely care about deeply, and the rest are more like... pleasant acquaintances? It's not that I dislike them, but I don't feel that deeper connection. I used to think something was wrong with me, especially seeing how easily some people seem to form close bonds. But I've come to realize that maybe I just have higher standards for what constitutes a real friendship. The people I do genuinely like, I would do anything for - and that means something. I'd rather have a few authentic connections than a bunch of surface-level friendships where I'm just going through the motions. ... score: 0.30272

I think it takes time to build trust and see someone's true character, so the fact that it takes you over a year to warm up doesn’t seem unusual at all.

Post: Callaway Pre-Owned: What condition is ‘good enough’?
I’ve bought from Callaway Pre-Owned before, but I’m curious if anyone knows which condition is the best value, per-say. They have four condition grades (like new, very good, good, average), and the prices cheapens as the condition gets worse.

If you have the experience, is it worth it to pay extra for ‘like new’ or is just ‘good’ or even ‘average’ the better route to be lighter on the wallet? Not to sound overly poor (however, I’m definitely not rich); I’d just like to save money whenever I can when it comes to this sport nowadays.

Reddit author comment: I have found “good” to be the best. I’ve bought wedges at both good and average. The difference was very significant. Good was damn near perfect, just a few scraps on the face. Average was a typical used club. Chipped paint, scratches on the bottom, worn face.

Could be wrong but I think when you buy the lowest quality they send you their worst club. If you order “good” there is a good change they send you a better quality club. I think like new is probably your worst value when you can get almost perfect clubs in “good” condition ... score: 0.34124

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've bought probably 6-7 clubs from Callaway Pre-Owned over the past few years and honestly, "Good" condition is the sweet spot for value. I've never been disappointed with a "Good" rated club - they usually just have some minor cosmetic wear on the sole or maybe a small ding on the crown of drivers, but nothing that affects performance whatsoever. The "Like New" stuff is barely discounted from retail price, so unless you're really particular about aesthetics, it's not worth it. I did try "Average" condition once on a wedge and while it was still playable, it had more wear than I was comfortable with for only saving like $20-30 more than "Good." The "Very Good" category is fine too, but "Good" gives you the best bang for your buck. Plus, Callaway's grading system is pretty conservative - their "Good" is often better than what other companies would call "Very Good." Just make sure to check their return policy because you can always send it back if you're not satisfied. ... score: 0.33315

I think “like new” is only worth paying for if you want something that feels fresh out of the wrapper, maybe as a gift or to complete a set.

I've played with "good" and even "average" condition clubs, and as long as you inspect the photos carefully and check the shaft and grip conditions, they perform very well.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've purchased several golf clubs from Callaway Pre-Owned, and I must say that the condition grades are quite accurate, in my experience. The 'like new' grade is perfect for those who want their clubs to look and feel like they just came out of the box, with minimal to no signs of wear. The 'very good' grade is also a great option, as the clubs may have some minor scratches or scuffs, but they still perform exceptionally well. However, if you're looking to save some money, the 'good' grade is definitely the way to go. I've found that the clubs in this grade still have plenty of life left in them, and the price difference is substantial. For example, I recently purchased a 'good' condition driver that was significantly cheaper than the 'like new' version, and it still performs great. The 'average' grade is a bit of a gamble, as the clubs may have more significant wear and tear, and the price savings may not be worth the potential decrease in performance. Overall, I think the 'good' grade offers the best value, as you can get a great club at a lower price without sacrificing too much in terms of performance. ... score: 0.3593

Post: What are basics to you?
Personal style advice often promotes developing solid basics, presumably neutral items that are fairly universal and are building blocks/foundations for more complicated pieces.

Do you feel basics exist? What are basics for you?

Do you care about the brand of your basics?

When do you replace basics?

How have your basics changed over time?

Do you find basics a meaningful term?

Reddit author comment: I think basics definitely exist but they're going to be different for everyone. I don't believe there's some list of perfect "wardrobe essentials" that's going to suit everyone's needs. For instance, I can't remember the last time I needed to wear a pair of black pumps.

For me, my basics are simple, nice, comfortable and reliable. Example: black super skinny jeans that are a bit heavier than the average pair, drapey gray modal-rayon blend t shirts, interesting wool cardigans in varying cuts, and well made loafers and oxfords that go to the cobbler for maintenance. It's really helpful for me to have basics that are easy to maintain and will last a while, aside from t shirts which I replace as I get bored. 

Another thing with basics is getting a good fit-- it's not going to be a reliable piece if you're even slightly unhappy with the fit-- I want my basics to be brainless and simple, but able make a cohesive outfit on their own. ... score: 0.30998

I used to think basics meant boring beige everything, but now I realize my "basic" might be someone else's statement piece.

They’re not necessarily boring; they’re just flexible. Brand matters to me mostly because I want my basics to last and feel good on my skin, so I tend to invest in mid-to-high quality.

Reddit author comment: Hi everyone,

All the people around me keep telling me I should invest. Now, in my late 20s, I finally have more money than I spend, so I’m ready to take the first step. The problem is: I have zero clue about ETFs and stocks. That’s why I wanted to ask for your opinion on my plan before I jump in:

I want to invest for at least 15+ years and keep the risk as low as possible. Based on that, I came up with the following ETF portfolio and allocations:

60% MSCI World (A1XB5U)

8% MSCI World ex USA (DBX0VH)

24% Emerging Markets IMI (A111X9)

8% FTSE India (A2PB5W)


Idea behind ex USA + India: I wanted to slightly reduce the heavy focus on the USA in the typical world ETF and add more exposure to India.

Post: What is your opinion on Nubank? $NU
Following today's correction, this investment appears to be an excellent opportunity. Its current valuation is roughly the same as it was at this time last year, yet its financials have significantly improved. Although the company missed earnings, I don't see that as a major concern as long as revenue continues to grow. 

Moreover, it serves as an interesting macroeconomic play, considering that new government policies might restrict US banks' foreign operations. 

I'm considering buying some shares, or perhaps even Leaps, to increase exposure.  
It feels a bit like déjà vu, but this time it's Nubank rather than SoFi.

Reddit author comment: I think the reaction to earnings is a mix between an overreaction and a slight correction. I do believe there is plenty of room for growth in the future though. They’ve only been in the Latin American market and still have the European and US markets to tap into when/if they’re ready. I also like that their lack of physical locations keeps their overhead much lower than other financial institutions. I think they have potential to be a decent hit in places like Europe and the US so I’m holding out for that. I’m buying more on this dip for sure to get my cost basis down. ... score: 0.34807

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been watching NU for a while now and I have to say I'm pretty bullish on their long-term prospects. The correction does seem like it might be creating a decent entry point, especially considering how much they've expanded their customer base over the past year. What really impresses me about Nubank is their digital-first approach in markets where traditional banking has been pretty antiquated - they're essentially leapfrogging decades of legacy infrastructure. The Brazil market alone is massive, and they're barely scratched the surface in Mexico and Colombia. Sure, the earnings miss stings a bit, but you're right that revenue growth is the key metric to watch here. They're still in that phase where they're prioritizing market share and customer acquisition over immediate profitability, which makes sense given the opportunity ahead of them. The regulatory environment in Latin America has been pretty favorable for fintechs too. I'm personally holding a small position and might add on any further weakness. The LEAPS idea is interesting - gives you time for the thesis to play out without the day-to-day volatility stress. ... score: 0.44484

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I think you're spot on about Nubank being an intriguing opportunity, especially after this recent pullback. The growth in their financials over the past year is impressive—customer acquisition is still strong, and their expansion into Mexico and Colombia seems to be gaining traction. While the earnings miss was a bummer, it was mostly due to higher spending on tech and marketing, which is typical for a company in growth mode. I also agree with your macro take: if US banks face tighter rules abroad, Nubank could benefit from less competition in Latin America. I'm personally building a position here and considering LEAPs as well, since I think Nubank could double in the next 2-3 years if they execute well. Just keep in mind the risks—emerging market volatility and potential regulation in Brazil are always a factor. But overall, I like the risk/reward at these levels. ... score: 0.47409

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I agree that Nubank presents an intriguing opportunity right now, especially given the recent pullback. Their ability to significantly improve financials while maintaining steady revenue growth is definitely a positive sign. The comparison to SoFi is interesting too — both are fintechs with strong growth potential, though Nubank’s focus on Latin America offers a unique market dynamic. The potential impact of new regulations on US banks might indeed give Nubank some room to expand its footprint, especially as it capitalizes on underserved populations in emerging markets. However, I’d be cautious about relying solely on macro trends; the competitive landscape in fintech is fierce, and execution risk remains high. If you’re comfortable with some volatility, LEAPS could be a smart way to gain leveraged exposure while limiting downside. Just make sure to keep an eye on their user growth metrics and how they manage credit risk going forward. Overall, I’m cautiously optimistic but would complement this with diversification. ... score: 0.56765

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I’ve been following Nubank for a while now, and I agree that the recent pullback presents a compelling opportunity. The company has shown remarkable growth in Latin America, particularly in Brazil, where it has become a household name. Their focus on digital banking and financial inclusion is something I deeply believe in, and the fact that they are expanding into other markets like Mexico and Colombia is a strong sign of their potential. I also think the macroeconomic factors you mentioned could play a significant role in their favor. However, I’m a bit more cautious about the earnings miss. While it’s not a deal-breaker, it’s important to keep an eye on how they manage to turn that around. I’m considering a small, long-term investment in Nubank, but I’ll probably wait for a bit more clarity on their earnings trajectory.

Post: What phones are the rich and famous using?
So, I’m a small business owner, security advisor and so much more… I recently embarked on the dumb phone journey. I understand the risks of SMS etc, but it’s only for personal ‘where are you’ or ‘on my way home’ type things. As part of this I’m moving away from the Apple ecosystem and moving to Linux, self hosting and secure email etc…

It got me thinking - what are the elite, celebs, government officials using as their daily drivers? What hardware should we be looking at and what could we be mirroring. It’s safe to say we’re being pushed hard on these little screens that monitor us, monetise us, and so much more, so knowing this, how are they escaping the loop? Zucks phone? Musk? 

It’s very much the Obamas BlackBerry discussion of the past, but nothing has really come close since right? 

Reddit author comment: There are some (anonymous) case studies in the [Extreme Privacy book](https://inteltechniques.com/book7.html), the tl;dr version is that while a secure / private phone matters, your opsec / following your privacy as a process is much more important.

BlackBerry is lost, they abandoned their (QNX based) platform and now produce low-end Android phones.

Celebs usually doesn't have to worry about their own government, and current high-end phones are really secure against an average person as attacker. When they get hacked, usually it is because they don't follow IT security practices and eg. have weak passwords.

Instead of celebs, you should study what journalists use in oppressing regimes. ... score: 0.34652

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Great question! From what I've gathered through various sources over the years, many high-profile individuals actually use multiple devices for different purposes. Government officials often have heavily modified phones with custom security features - think encrypted everything, ability to remote wipe, and sometimes even hardware modifications. The BlackBerry you mentioned was popular because of its enterprise-grade encryption, but even those had to be specially configured for someone like Obama. Celebrities seem to vary more - some stick with iPhones but have their security teams lock them down hardcore, while others go the route you're exploring with more privacy-focused alternatives. I've heard rumors that some tech billionaires actually use fairly basic phones for personal communication, saving the smartphones purely for business. The key seems to be compartmentalization - they're not trying to do everything on one device like the rest of us. They might have a secure phone for sensitive calls, a regular phone for social media teams to manage, and sometimes even burner phones for certain situations. ... score: 0.37773

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a fascinating topic, especially as more people become aware of privacy and surveillance concerns. From what I’ve read, a lot of high-profile individuals—think politicians, CEOs, and celebs—don’t actually use anything all that unusual, but they do implement much stricter security protocols. For example, some government officials are still given highly locked-down iPhones or custom Androids with most features disabled (no app store, no Bluetooth, etc.). Others, like the President or certain cabinet members, might use specialized secure devices, but those aren’t available to the public. I’ve also seen reports that some tech moguls like Zuckerberg actually use multiple phones—one for work, one for personal, and maybe even burner phones for specific purposes. As for Musk, he’s rumored to use an iPhone, but again, it’s likely heavily customized and managed by a security team. If you’re looking to mirror their practices, focus less on the specific hardware and more on a layered approach: minimal apps, encrypted messaging (like Signal), and, for really sensitive stuff, maybe even an air-gapped device. ... score: 0.40472

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: It’s a fascinating topic! From what I’ve gathered over the years, many high-profile individuals—whether politicians, celebrities, or tech moguls—tend to use customized or heavily secured versions of mainstream devices rather than exotic hardware. For example, the BlackBerry was once the gold standard due to its encryption and secure messaging capabilities, but since then, the landscape has shifted. People like Elon Musk have been rumored to use Android devices with custom ROMs or hardened security layers. The key takeaway is that these folks often prioritize secure communication channels, sometimes with hardware-level modifications or using secure apps like Signal. So, if you’re moving to Linux and self-hosting, you’re on the right path, but also consider hardened Android builds or even security-focused phones like the Purism Librem or PinePhone, which emphasize open-source software and privacy. ... score: 0.37055

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think that the rich and famous are using a variety of phones, but the one that stands out to me is the GrapheneOS-powered device. This phone is known for its exceptional security features, including a highly secure operating system and robust encryption methods. The fact that it's based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) means that it's free from the proprietary software that can be found on traditional Android devices. I'm not surprised that some of the elite are using this phone, given its reputation for being highly secure and private. In fact, I've heard that some government officials and high-profile individuals are using this phone as their daily driver. The reason for this is that it offers a level of security and anonymity that's hard to find in other phones. For example, GrapheneOS has a feature called "Vanadium" which is a hardened WebView component that provides an additional layer of security when browsing the web. Additionally, the phone's operating system is designed to be highly customizable, allowing users to tailor their experience to their specific needs.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: **u/MarketWatcher2025**: Been thinking a lot about the current market environment and wanted to share some observations. We're seeing some interesting divergences between growth and value stocks lately, especially in the tech sector. While the mega-caps have been relatively stable, there's been significant rotation into smaller cap names that were beaten down last year. I've been gradually increasing my position in international developed markets through VEA and VXUS, as the dollar strength seems to be moderating and valuations overseas look more attractive. The yield curve dynamics are also worth watching - we're seeing some normalization but it's still not entirely healthy.

For anyone just starting out, it’s really important to understand how these rate changes can impact everything from stocks to bonds to real estate. Higher rates usually mean borrowing gets more expensive, which can slow down economic growth but also creates opportunities in bonds (yields go up!).

Post: Knee pain when hiking down, not going up or on flat trails
When the hiking is 10+ miles with 3000k ft elevation gain, I start to get keen pain when going down.  I'm not sure what I can do to minimize or eliminate the knee pain.  Please share your thoughts. 

When I do smaller hikes than that, I don't get any pain.

Reddit author comment: I have the same issue. Or rather, I did have the same issue. It never occurred to me to try it for many years, but one day I finally bought some hiking/trekking poles, and they have made all the difference. It’s like night and day. I used to get such bad knee pain going downhill that I was afraid I would have to give up hiking. But putting my weight on the poles with my arms reduces the strain on my knees enough that they don’t hurt more than the usual tires soreness after a long hike.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've dealt with this exact same issue for years! Downhill hiking puts way more stress on your knees than uphill - you're essentially doing controlled falls with each step and your quads have to work overtime to absorb that impact. A few things that have really helped me: First, invest in trekking poles if you don't already have them - they're absolute game changers for taking pressure off your knees on descents. Second, focus on your technique - take shorter steps, land on your midfoot rather than heel striking, and try to keep your knees slightly bent to act as shock absorbers. Third, strengthen your quads and glutes at home with exercises like squats, lunges, and step-downs. The stronger these muscles are, the better they can support your knees during long descents. Also consider the terrain - sometimes taking a slightly longer but less steep route down can save your knees a lot of pain. I used to push through the pain thinking it would get better, but addressing it proactively made such a huge difference in my hiking enjoyment. ... score: 0.42985

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey, I’ve dealt with the same thing and it’s pretty common among hikers, especially on longer descents.

Second, focus on strengthening your quads, hamstrings, and glutes—stronger muscles help absorb the shock. Also, try to shorten your stride and keep your knees slightly bent instead of locking them out with each step.

This helps to reduce the impact on my knees and can make a big difference. I've also found that using trekking poles can be incredibly helpful, as they allow me to take some of the weight off my knees and distribute it more evenly. Additionally, I make sure to stretch regularly, both before and after my hikes, to keep my muscles loose and flexible.

Post: Black Lotus Mitigations Testing
I've been working on testing the mitigations for a week, working off of Microsoft's documentation.  I have tried performing the steps on the last 4 generations of laptops that we have and it won't work on any of them.  No entries in the event logs.  It just doesn't apply it and the registry key is changed back to zero after a reboot.  I've tested on an HP Elitebook g6, g7, g8, and g9 so far.  All have the latest firmware and Windows updates.  Has anyone else been having issues?

Reddit author comment: Am I missing something here?  MS is going to force these changes at some point within the next 12 months which could result in bricking a portion of devices.  As stated in the CVE article, "**CAUTION** After the mitigation for this issue is enabled on a device, meaning the mitigations have been applied, it cannot be reverted if you continue to use Secure Boot on that device. Even reformatting of the disk will not remove the revocations if they have already been applied."  No one seems to be worried about this.  I know that we can turn off secure boot, but that isn't a great option and I'd hate to have to do that to 500 computers in a really short time frame.   

To be clear, we aren't worried about Black Lotus, we are just trying to make sure that Microsoft's enforcement of the mitigation isn't going to brick half our laptops.  I'm finding contradicting information out there regarding how and when they plan on rolling this out.  Personally I think it's ridiculous that MS doesn't plan to release this as an OOB optional update.  So in the meantime, I'm fighting with getting this working just to hedge our bets that MS won't screw this up. ... score: 0.35467

Post: Can I line a fancy dress with something other than satin?
I want to make this dress with silk chiffon from photo 2/3.  For the lining, I really hate the feeling of poly satin.  I’m also not looking to break the bank on a silk lining. Is there other fabrics that still work well for this? I’m cool with cotton or poly blends etc, I just want it to feel comfortable but not be clingy to the chiffon and effect the drape. 

Reddit author comment: Lining fabric is a guideline, not a rule--it means that the fabric has the qualities that tend to be useful in lining, especially slip, but it's totally fine to use other fabrics.

For this, a purpose-made lining fabric is not necessarily optimal, as you want something pretty opaque since the chiffon is sheer.

There are poly satins out there that feel much nicer than poly lining fabrics which are made to be inexpensive.

I've lined stuff in rayon challis, but not sure if chiffon will slip over it. I did see some $12-15/yard rayon satins the other day, I think, that would probably be fine.

I think most cottons would not be slippery enough.

My go-to recommendation is cotton lawn or cotton voile - they're both lightweight, breathable, and have a smooth finish that won't cling to your chiffon. They're also significantly cheaper than silk linings. Another excellent option is rayon challis, which has a beautiful drape and feels luxurious against the skin without the hefty price tag. If you want something with a bit more structure, consider cotton sateen (not satin) - it has a subtle sheen and smooth hand but isn't as slippery or clingy as poly satin. For poly blends, look for polyester crepe de chine or a poly-cotton blend lining fabric. The key is finding something with a smooth surface that won't grab the chiffon but also has enough body to support the outer fabric without adding bulk. I'd recommend taking a small swatch of your chiffon with you when fabric shopping so you can test how different linings interact with it. The drape is crucial for a fancy dress, so you want something that enhances rather than hinders the beautiful flow of silk chiffon. ... score: 0.42374

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, you have some great options besides poly satin! If comfort is your priority and you don’t want to spend a ton on silk, consider using a lightweight cotton voile or cotton lawn for the lining. Both are breathable, soft, and less likely to cling to the silk chiffon than something with more texture. They also tend to drape nicely, so they won’t interfere much with the flow of your outer fabric. If you want something a little slicker, try a rayon bemberg lining—it’s often used in higher-end garments and feels really nice against the skin, plus it’s not as expensive as silk. Just make sure to pre-wash your lining fabric so you don’t get weird shrinkage later! ... score: 0.41863

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Absolutely, you can definitely use alternatives to satin for lining your silk chiffon dress! Since you want to avoid the slippery, clingy feel of polyester satin and also want to keep costs down, I’d suggest looking into lightweight cotton voile or batiste. Both are breathable and soft against the skin, and they won’t fight with the chiffon in terms of drape. Another option could be a lightweight rayon challis, which has a nice smooth finish but is usually more affordable than silk linings. Just make sure whatever you pick is thin enough so it doesn’t add bulk or alter the flow of your chiffon. Good luck with your dress! ... score: 0.46436

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I completely understand where you're coming from, and I'm happy to help you explore some alternatives to satin for lining your fancy dress! One option you might consider is a high-quality cotton lawn or voile - these fabrics are known for their softness, breathability, and gentle drape, which would work beautifully with the silk chiffon. Another option could be a poly-blend charmeuse, which has a smooth, lustrous surface that would help the chiffon move freely without clinging. If you're looking for something a bit more luxurious, you could also consider a silk habotai or a cotton-silk blend - these fabrics have a lovely texture and a subtle sheen that would complement the chiffon nicely. Ultimately, the key is to choose a lining fabric that has a similar weight and drape to the chiffon, so that it doesn't disrupt the overall flow of the dress. I hope this helps, and I'd be happy to discuss further if you have any other questions! ... score: 0.40273

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Absolutely, there are many options for lining your dress that don't involve satin! You might want to consider using a lightweight cotton voile or a polyester blend with a high cotton content. These fabrics have a softer, more breathable feel than poly satin, but they're still smooth enough to prevent clinging and preserve the drape of your chiffon. You could also explore using rayon or bamboo linings, which are known for their silky texture and excellent drape. Just make sure to choose a lining fabric that is lighter in weight than your chiffon to maintain the overall flow and movement of the dress. ... score: 0.45811

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Absolutely, you can definitely use alternatives to satin for your dress lining! I've had great success with a lightweight cotton voile. It's breathable, soft, and won't cling to the chiffon, which is crucial for maintaining the dress's drape. Another option is a fine poly-cotton blend, which is a bit more durable and can handle more wear and tear. Both of these fabrics are much more comfortable against the skin and won't break the bank. Just make sure to pre-wash them to avoid any shrinkage issues. If you're concerned about the weight, you can also try a silk organza lining. It’s a bit more expensive than cotton but still less pricey than silk and it provides a beautiful structure without adding bulk. Good luck with your project, and I can't wait to see the finished dress! ... score: 0.47973
