Post: Voices.
Do some people hear voices during mood episodes and if so what kind. I was talking to my syc and apparently some people with bipolar can hear voices at times. 

Reddit author comment: unfortunately yes, this entire week (6 days now) I haven’t been able to sleep in conjunction with my usual schedule which is usually 9 solid hours and up early. 
the last 6 days I’m getting maybe 1 or 2 hours and falling asleep at 7am from the day before and my brain is SCREAMING at me from sleep deprivation - that’s when the auditory hallucinations kick in, its very much internal and it’s not as if I can hear something that isn’t there but my ears will ring or buzz or I will hear what sounds like 5 people having a conversation at I’ve inside head OR it sounds like I have a narrator questioning and explaining everything out loud without my consent to do so 😵‍💫 ... score: 0.78272

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yes, this is actually more common than people realize! During severe mood episodes, especially manic episodes with psychotic features or severe depression, some people with bipolar can experience auditory hallucinations. In my experience during a particularly bad manic episode a few years ago, I heard what sounded like whispers or conversations that weren't really there - usually when I was alone at night. They weren't necessarily commanding voices like you might hear about with schizophrenia, but more like background chatter that felt real in the moment. During my worst depressive episode, I occasionally heard critical voices telling me I was worthless. It's important to know that this doesn't mean you have a different condition - psychotic features can be part of bipolar disorder. The key is being honest with your psychiatrist about these experiences so they can adjust your treatment accordingly. Antipsychotics helped me a lot during those episodes, and now that I'm stable on mood stabilizers, I don't experience this anymore. ... score: 0.69387

The voices can vary a lot—some people hear their name being called, others might hear more elaborate conversations or commands. Sometimes the voices are neutral, but often they can be critical, frightening, or even comforting. What’s important is that these experiences don’t necessarily mean someone has schizophrenia; psychotic symptoms can be part of bipolar disorder, especially during intense episodes.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Yeah, I’ve experienced hearing voices during severe mood episodes, especially when I was in a manic state. For me, the voices weren’t always clear or coherent—they felt more like whispers or fragments of conversations that I couldn’t fully understand. Sometimes they were encouraging, other times really critical or negative, which made things pretty overwhelming. From what I’ve read and heard from others with bipolar, it’s not super common but definitely possible, particularly during psychotic features of mania or severe depression. It’s important to note that hearing voices doesn’t mean you’re “losing it” or anything—it’s just one of the many symptoms the brain can throw out during extreme mood swings. If you or someone you know experiences this, talking to a psychiatrist about it can help manage those symptoms better. ... score: 0.62793

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think it's essential to acknowledge that hearing voices can be a common symptom in various mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and severe depression. Research suggests that approximately 25% of people with bipolar disorder experience auditory hallucinations, which can manifest as hearing voices. These voices can be either positive or negative, and in some cases, they can be commanding or critical. It's crucial to understand that hearing voices is not a sign of weakness or a personal failing, but rather a symptom that requires proper treatment and management. I appreciate your post for shedding light on this often-stigmatized topic, and I hope it encourages more people to open up about their experiences and seek help if needed.

It's not as common as other symptoms like mood swings, but it does happen and can be very distressing. The voices can be positive, negative, or neutral, and they might comment on the person’s actions or express various thoughts. It’s important to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with a mental health professional about these experiences. They can help determine if the voices are a symptom of bipolar disorder or if there might be other factors at play, like anxiety or even medication side effects. It’s also crucial to have a solid support system, whether that’s friends, family, or support groups, to help navigate these challenging experiences. ... score: 0.60166

Post: grieving my pre-ocd self
i know i technically was never a pre-ocd version of myself, but it was minor for most of my life but worsened very quickly and severely when i was 18 (20 now). my ocd is based around contamination and i think about when i was able to do things that i now deem gross, like touching doorknobs, using another person's pencils or class supplies, tying my shoes.. just wondering if there is anyone else whose ocd developed a bit "later" and can relate

Reddit author comment: Totally feel you on this. I’m 24 and didn’t “feel or have” symptoms till I was like 20. I miss the things I used to be able to do without a second thought like taking meds when I’m sick or eating out at a restaurant. There are so many things that my 18 year old self did that would genuinely send me into a full crash out now. Asking a random mom for advil, taking a sip of a friends drink at the bar, leaving my house without unplugging everything bc what if it causes a fire, ANY recreational drugs. Used to smoke weed a lot and now I’d rather die than take the smallest baby toke.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I completely understand this feeling and you're definitely not alone in experiencing OCD that intensified later in life. I'm 24 now and mine really ramped up around 19-20, also with contamination themes. Before that, I had some quirks but nothing that really interfered with my daily life. Now I look back at photos of myself casually eating food at restaurants, touching public surfaces without a second thought, or sharing drinks with friends and it feels like watching a different person entirely. There's this weird grief that comes with it - mourning a version of yourself that felt more carefree and spontaneous. I think what makes it harder is that we have these vivid memories of being able to do things that now feel impossible, which can make the contrast feel even more stark. It's important to remember that recovery is possible though, and many people do get back to doing things they once enjoyed. The brain is remarkably adaptable, even if it doesn't feel that way right now. Have you been able to connect with any treatment resources?

I also have contamination themes, and it’s wild looking back at old photos or memories and realizing how carefree I used to be about things like sharing drinks or not washing my hands after touching public stuff.

Post: Is Naofumi trying to make everyone hate him and if so why? (The Rising of the Shield Hero)
Hi all, I just finished episode 8 and in that episode Raphtalia asked if Naofumi was trying to make everyone hate him. I might've forgotten something but is that true and what would the point be or is he actually just kinda mean?

Reddit author comment: I only read the webnovel, and the anime is based off of the light novels which almost completely diverge after book 2, but I'm pretty sure they're the same in season 1 so the answer I remember is 'No'. He's not trying to get people to hate him. He just doesn't care what people think about him because he assumes they already hate him or would otherwise treat him poorly/exploit him.

But I read this like a decade ago, so I might not remember the nuances.

Yeah Naofumi is kinda mean but it's a result of his immense ptsd/depression. Idk if they conveyed that clearly in the anime but in the webnovel it's pretty clear. iirc he can't even taste anymore ever since his trauma. ... score: 0.68604

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yeah, Naofumi is definitely putting up walls and pushing people away, but it's not because he's naturally mean - it's a trauma response from being falsely accused and betrayed so early on. Think about it: he was summoned to save the world, immediately framed for rape, stripped of his money and reputation, and abandoned by literally everyone except slave traders. That kind of betrayal would mess anyone up psychologically. He's adopted this cynical, abrasive persona as a defense mechanism because if he expects the worst from people and keeps them at arm's length, he can't be hurt again. It's easier to be the "bad guy" than to risk opening up and getting stabbed in the back again. Raphtalia sees through this facade because she's been with him long enough to witness his genuine kindness beneath the bitter exterior. He saved her, cared for her when she was sick, and protected her despite claiming he only sees her as a tool. The guy is clearly hurting and using meanness as armor. ... score: 0.6823

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a great question and a pretty central theme to Naofumi’s character, especially in the early part of the show. It’s not that Naofumi is *trying* to make everyone hate him, but after being falsely accused and seeing how the kingdom immediately turned on him, he’s basically given up on trying to win people over. He adopts this “lone wolf” persona as a defense mechanism because he feels like he can’t trust anyone except Raphtalia. So, when he acts cold or indifferent, it’s more about protecting himself from further betrayal. It might look like he’s purposely pushing people away, but it’s really just a reaction to the trauma and injustice he’s faced. Over time, you’ll see that his attitude starts to change as he slowly rebuilds trust, mostly thanks to Raphtalia and others who genuinely care about him. ... score: 0.61645

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I don’t think Naofumi is actively trying to make everyone hate him, but given the circumstances he’s in, it kind of comes off that way sometimes. Remember, he was falsely accused and betrayed right at the start, so he’s naturally guarded and defensive. He’s not mean for the sake of being mean; it’s more like self-preservation and mistrust. He’s been forced into a corner where he can’t rely on others, so his bluntness and sometimes cold attitude are a way to protect himself from further harm. Raphtalia’s question might be more about how his behavior appears to others rather than his true intentions. Naofumi’s actions are shaped by trauma, and while he might not be the most socially graceful hero, he’s genuinely trying to survive and get stronger to protect those who trust him. So, no, he’s not trying to make everyone hate him—he just hasn’t had much of a chance to show his good side yet. ... score: 0.64647

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think Naofumi is trying to make everyone hate him, at least to some extent. I believe he's doing this as a form of self-protection, given the betrayal and abuse he suffered at the hands of Malty and the rest of the nobles. It's like he's putting up walls around himself, making it difficult for others to get close, so he doesn't get hurt again. This behavior could also be a result of his past experiences, where being nice and trusting led to him being taken advantage of. By being perceived as mean or standoffish, Naofumi may be trying to deter people from getting too close, thus avoiding the risk of being betrayed or hurt once more. Moreover, his actions could be a cry for help, a desperate attempt to get someone to notice him and understand his pain, even if it's through negative attention. It's also possible that Naofumi is struggling with feelings of guilt and shame, stemming from the false accusations and his subsequent treatment, which could be contributing to his behavior. Overall, I think Naofumi's actions are complex and multifaceted, driven by a mix of self-protection, past trauma, and a deep-seated need for connection and understanding. ... score: 0.68614

Naofumi's been through a lot, and his harsh behavior is a defensive mechanism. He doesn't want to open himself up to further hurt, so he pushes others away.

But I think it's more about his trauma and the way he's been treated. He's been through so much, from being betrayed by his party members to being accused of rape. It's like he's built up this wall to protect himself, and he's using it to keep everyone at a distance. Maybe he thinks if he pushes people away, he won't get hurt again.

Post: Does your OCD seem real (to you)?
Hi all! I was identified with OCD a few months ago by a therapist after I’d been experiencing increasingly violent intrusive thoughts during a major burnout period. In this journey, I’ve come to learn a lot of my thought patterns are OCD and I just didn’t catch it. I used to work in psych assessment, so I was a bit surprised to not recognize it in myself. With the help of some rest and medication, the violent OCD themes have subsided at least. However, the others still linger. 

Because this is still so new to me and I’ve used other language to talk about my thoughts and anxieties for the longest time, I have a lot of trouble identifying my OCD themes and spirals until I’m so caught in a compulsion cycle that I’m sobbing and hyperventilating. I’ve talked with my therapist a bit about this (who also has OCD), but sometimes I doubt if it even is OCD or just my fucked up trauma brain. What even is a compulsion?? How am I supposed to catch that I’m obsessing over a theme when it seems like a perfectly reasonable and logical rabbit hole for my brain to go down?? Do I even have OCD??? Is /this/ OCD?? 

Does anyone relate or have any experience with this to share? Anything is appreciated :-)

Reddit author comment: the fact that i have an inclination to spiral in thought for hours, or days, on any subject,(including this if i let myself), and compensate the resulting anxiety; plus having to actively fight that inclination tells me there is definitely some aspect of a clinical definition of ocd that i experience. the more i let myself think about it the more i question and doubt; and that in itself is the nature of ocd. you have tendencies to this thing, allowing yourself to go down mental rabbit holes and spirals is not normal when it causes anxiety and happens daily. there are many aspects that apply to you. don’t overthink it because these things fall into place and if you didn’t have it, that would likely be found. ... score: 0.63705

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh wow, I relate to this SO much. I've had OCD for years but only got diagnosed recently, and the "does this feel real" question hits hard. For me, the biggest lightbulb moment was realizing that OCD thoughts feel EXTREMELY real and urgent in the moment - that's literally what makes them so distressing. Like, when I'm spiraling about whether I locked the door, it doesn't feel like "silly OCD brain being irrational." It feels like "OH GOD what if someone breaks in and it's all my fault because I didn't check properly." The thoughts feel completely logical and the anxiety feels totally justified. That's the cruel trick of OCD - it hijacks your logical brain and makes unreasonable things seem not just possible, but probable and catastrophic. As for compulsions, they're basically anything you do to try to reduce the anxiety from the obsessive thoughts - checking, researching, asking for reassurance, mental reviewing, avoiding certain situations. Sometimes they're obvious (like checking locks 10 times) but sometimes they're subtle (like mentally reviewing conversations to make sure you didn't say something wrong). The fact that you're questioning whether it's "real" OCD is actually pretty typical - OCD loves to make us doubt our own experiences and diagnoses. ... score: 0.7004

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I relate to this so much. I was diagnosed with OCD about a year ago, but before that, I just thought I was anxious and “overly analytical.” The thing that really tripped me up was how real and logical my thoughts felt in the moment. Like, if I was obsessing over whether I’d accidentally offended someone, it never felt like an irrational fear — it felt like a very real, urgent problem I had to solve or fix. Only after the fact, when I’d spent hours ruminating or apologizing repeatedly, would I realize it was probably OCD. My therapist helped me start identifying compulsions as anything I did to try to reduce the anxiety or “solve” the thought, even if it just felt like regular problem-solving in the moment. It’s tricky, and I still catch myself doubting if it’s “really” OCD, but I think that’s just another part of the disorder. You’re definitely not alone in this. ... score: 0.64539

It’s like your brain convinces you that these intrusive thoughts or doubts are just logical concerns, and you spiral deeper without realizing it’s OCD. For me, a compulsion isn’t always something obvious like hand-washing or checking; sometimes it’s mental rituals—repeating phrases silently or overanalyzing every detail in conversations.

The struggles you're facing in identifying your OCD themes and spirals are all too familiar, and I'm more than happy to share my experiences with you. For me, it's been a journey of self-discovery, and it's taken a lot of time, patience, and effort to develop the skills to recognize when I'm slipping into a compulsion cycle. One thing that has helped me is keeping a thought journal, where I write down my thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations throughout the day. This has allowed me to identify patterns and triggers that I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. I've also found it helpful to work with my therapist to develop a list of "red flags" that indicate I'm entering a compulsive state. These can be things like repetitive thoughts, physical tension, or avoidance behaviors. By being more aware of these signs, I've been able to catch myself earlier and earlier, and intervene before things escalate. I want to assure you that it's completely normal to doubt whether your experiences are "real" OCD or just a result of trauma or other factors. But from what you've shared, it sounds like you're experiencing many of the classic symptoms of OCD, including intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and avoidance behaviors.

Post: Has anyone had any luck treating OCD with only meds and no therapy?
I've started taking an SSRI for my OCD and anxiety a few months ago, but I am extremely hesitant to go to therapy. I am honestly, incredibly hesitant to share my compulsions, anxiety and thoughts with other people. I don't even know how I would begin to even explain my problems to a psychiatrist/therapist. 

I'm really hoping there are some people here who've had luck significantly reducing their symptoms without therapy. I don't expect to completely get rid of my OCD, but just to manage the symptoms. 

Reddit author comment: Is it possible, maybe ? But i would encourage you to try therapy. The first few session are hard, awkaward, etc. But it helped me rationnalize a lot better because I have to explain it. Also, majortity of therapist wont judge you. OCD is bot rational, a good therapist understand that and helps you deal with it. She doesn’t try to tell me why I am wrong. She know and I know that nothing Will happen if I don’t do XYZ, but my brain won’t stop. So we find tricks and solution.

My compulsions decreased, but some days were still really tough, especially when I was stressed. From what my psychiatrist told me, meds can definitely help manage symptoms, and some people find that’s enough for their daily functioning. But therapy (especially ERP) is considered the gold standard because it teaches you coping skills and helps you face the fears behind the compulsions.

However, from what I've read and experienced, medication often works best when combined with some form of therapy, like CBT or ERP, because it helps you develop coping strategies and directly address the compulsions and intrusive thoughts. That said, if therapy feels too overwhelming right now, maybe start with small steps—like journaling your thoughts or even seeing a therapist just to talk about your general feelings, not your OCD specifically.

Yesterday my psychiatrist used the word “ocd flare” saying he thinks I’m in a really bad ocd flare. I’ve never heard this term used before.. anyone else get “ocd flares”? What’s yours like? 

Reddit author comment: Personally I don't like calling them flares or flare ups. 
I just call it a "bad day". But this is a personal preference, as I don't like the term flare up, makes me sound like I'm sick. And that's a thought I don't need lol

But my "bad days" are basically when all symptoms are extreme and often completely uncontrollable. 
I have "good insight" (a term my psychologist used) and have a somewhat decent ability to avoid some of the things I struggle with, on a good day. 
But bad days, I feel out of control. Often more than a few days at a time too. ... score: 0.67917

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yes, my psychiatrist uses this term too! I think of OCD flares like how people describe autoimmune flares - periods where symptoms are significantly worse than baseline. For me, a flare usually happens during times of high stress, major life changes, or sometimes seemingly out of nowhere. During a flare, my usual compulsions that might take 10-15 minutes suddenly balloon into hour-long rituals. My intrusive thoughts become more frequent and distressing, and I lose a lot of the coping skills I've built up through therapy. It's like my brain gets stuck in this hypervigilant mode where everything feels dangerous or "wrong." The checking behaviors get intense - I'll check locks, appliances, emails dozens of times. Sleep gets disrupted because my mind won't quiet down. Usually lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months for me, then gradually settles back to my normal manageable level. It's actually really validating to have a term for it because it acknowledges that OCD symptoms can fluctuate significantly over time. ... score: 0.71162

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Yeah, my therapist and psychiatrist both use the term “flare” when describing periods where my OCD symptoms get much worse than usual. It’s kind of like how people with chronic physical illnesses have flare-ups when their symptoms intensify. For me, an OCD flare is usually triggered by stress, lack of sleep, or big life changes. Suddenly, I’ll notice that my intrusive thoughts are way more frequent and harder to dismiss, and my compulsions (like checking or reassurance seeking) spike up. Sometimes I even develop new compulsions during a flare. It can feel really overwhelming, but I try to remind myself that it’s temporary, and with the right coping tools and support, things usually settle down again. You’re definitely not alone in this! ... score: 0.75627

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Yeah, I’ve definitely experienced what my therapist called an “OCD flare” and it’s a pretty accurate way to describe it. For me, it’s like my usual OCD symptoms ramp up significantly – the intrusive thoughts become more intense and frequent, and the compulsions feel almost impossible to resist. It’s exhausting because during a flare, I notice that my anxiety levels are through the roof and I have way less control than usual. Sometimes, it can last days or even weeks, and it often feels like I’m back at square one. I think “flare” is a helpful term because it suggests OCD symptoms can fluctuate in severity, much like other chronic conditions. If you’re going through one now, just know it’s temporary and reaching out for support, like your psychiatrist did, is a great step. What kind of compulsions or thoughts do you notice get worse during your flare? ... score: 0.74078

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think I do experience OCD flares, but for me, they're often triggered by stress or anxiety, and they can manifest in different ways - sometimes it's an increase in intrusive thoughts, other times it's a compulsion to perform certain rituals or behaviors, and occasionally it's a combination of both. I've found that when I'm in the midst of an OCD flare, it's really hard to focus on anything else, and even everyday tasks can feel overwhelming.

For me, it usually starts with a small, seemingly insignificant trigger, like a change in my routine or a stressful event. Suddenly, my OCD symptoms become much more intense and frequent. My compulsions, which I usually have a handle on, become overwhelming, and I find myself spending hours a day on them. It's like my brain gets stuck in this endless loop of anxiety and reassurance-seeking. When I'm in a flare, simple tasks become incredibly difficult, and my quality of life really takes a hit. I've found that it helps to have a plan in place, like reaching out to my therapist or using specific coping strategies. It can be really isolating, but knowing that others go through this too makes it a bit easier to manage.

Post: Memory loss
Anyone else in here at can’t remember shit? I can’t remember short term or long term. Sometimes things will come to me days after. Sometimes it’s literally years before a random memory pops up. Not all trauma memories just simple stuff too. I also have ADHD but all my psychiatrist try to give me anti depressants. I’m not depressed I just got chronic ptsd and my memory is funky. 

Reddit author comment: For sure. My focus and short term memory are not great. Part of it is that I have a very busy life, I have 2 young kids etc etc. I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD and am primarily inattentive type (more classically thought of as ADD), and treating that has made a difference in my focus which I find helps me remember better, but I completely understand where you are coming from.

In terms of the antidepressant that your psychiatrist may have recommended it may have been for a few other reasons than them simply thinking you are depressed. Some of those medications help to reduce or regulate cortisol (the stress hormone) release that is associated with PTSD. ADHD also fucks up the release or transfer of dopamine to certain parts of your brain which can leave people feeling depressed . I AM NOT medically trained and I don't know almost anything about the technical side of medications. My mother is a retired pharmacist and has explained some of this in these terms, as well as the Nurse Practitioner who diagnosed my ADHD, just trying to offer some potential insight as to why that may have been a suggested course of action. ... score: 0.67673

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Holy shit, yes! I thought I was losing my mind until I started researching the connection between PTSD and memory issues. It's actually super common - trauma literally rewires how our brains store and retrieve memories. The hippocampus (which handles memory formation) gets all messed up when we're in chronic fight-or-flight mode. I have the same thing where I'll randomly remember something from like 5 years ago while I can't remember what I had for breakfast. It's not just the "bad" memories either - it's like my brain just decided to file everything in the wrong cabinet. Have you looked into EMDR therapy? It's specifically designed for PTSD and some people say it helps with the memory fog too. Also, if you have ADHD on top of PTSD, that's like a double whammy for memory issues. Maybe try pushing back on the antidepressant thing and ask specifically about PTSD-focused treatments? Your brain isn't broken, it's just trying to protect you in a really inconvenient way. ... score: 0.7149

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, you’re not alone. Memory issues can be a huge part of both ADHD and CPTSD, and it’s super frustrating when people (especially professionals) brush it off or try to treat it as depression. I relate a lot to what you’re saying—sometimes I’ll forget what I did yesterday, or I’ll be in a conversation and suddenly a random memory from years ago will hit me out of nowhere. It’s not that I’m not paying attention, it’s just like my brain is on a delay or has huge gaps. I read somewhere that the stress from PTSD can impact how your brain stores and retrieves memories, and ADHD makes it even harder to keep things in the short-term “working memory.” It sucks that psychiatrists just want to throw antidepressants at you instead of actually addressing what you’re describing.

It’s really common for people with chronic PTSD to experience memory disruptions, not just with traumatic events but with everyday stuff too. The brain sometimes prioritizes or suppresses certain memories as a coping mechanism, which can make it feel like you’re losing chunks of time or details. It sucks that your psychiatrists keep pushing antidepressants when you don’t feel depressed—sometimes it takes finding someone who specializes in trauma or ADHD to get a treatment plan that addresses your specific struggles, like therapy focused on trauma processing or even ADHD coaching.

Post: How do you know if you have PTSD?
How do you know if you have PTSD? I know what I went through was traumatic. It has been 6 months now since I have been away from it. I had severe anxiety and depression from long before and it’s mostly treatment resistant. I’m having a hard time figuring out if this is just my normal severe anxiety or if it could be mixed with PTSD now. I have a therapist and psychiatrist I am working with. I have made a lot of progress in some ways. I just don’t know if this is the start of PTSD or not and it scared me

Reddit author comment: you get a diagnosis from your therapist or other professional. for me, i was inpatient and suffering greatly so there was really no question for them, and i did not contradict them.

ptsd is one of those things that needs caution in self-diagnosis, as there are other disorders that have severe anxiety (gad), or have definite triggers leading to strange behavior (ocd), or psychotic behavior (a whole suite of them), etc.

being past the 6 month mark, if you're experiencing the symptoms, it will be ptsd instead of pts.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I really understand your confusion and fear about this - it's actually pretty common to wonder whether what you're experiencing is PTSD, especially when you already have existing anxiety and depression. The overlap between these conditions can make it really difficult to tease apart what's what. From what I've learned through my own therapy journey, PTSD typically involves specific symptoms that go beyond general anxiety: intrusive thoughts or flashbacks about the traumatic event, nightmares, avoiding things that remind you of the trauma, feeling emotionally numb or disconnected, being hypervigilant or easily startled, and having negative thoughts about yourself or the world that started after the trauma. The fact that you're already working with both a therapist and psychiatrist is huge - they're really the best people to help you figure this out. It might help to keep a symptom journal noting when you have difficult moments and what triggers them, so you can discuss patterns with your treatment team.

Sometimes it also shows up as irritability, trouble sleeping, or difficulty concentrating. Since you already work with a therapist and psychiatrist, it might help to bring up these specific symptoms and see if they resonate with your experience.

Post: Asymmetric grandparents, in-laws uninterested
Anybody else with one set of grandparents who are just kind of duds? My in-laws say they want to see our kids and clearly take pride in being grandparents, but whenever they're here they just kind of dawdle around in the orbit of our children and only seem to have motivation to *be* grandparents sporadically.

We have a 3 year old and a set of twins who are ~10 months, so it definitely can be a lot to be around them at times, but their other grandparents (my parents) are always super hands-on and asking when they can get more time and what they can do to help.

My wife has noticed the difference, it clearly bothers her, and I don't know what to do about it. Frankly, it bugs the shit out of me, but I don't want to pile on or feed into a negative cycle, so I just try to frame it as them trying their best while validating that I've noticed it.

Anybody been in a similar situation and how did it pan out?



Reddit author comment: My dad absolutely adores our two boys, but when he flew across the country to visit us a year and a half ago, I swear he spent 90% of the time just sitting on our couch staring at his phone. He missed several dinners with us because he was passed out on the couch asleep. It was like pulling teeth getting him to actually come out of the house and do things with us (He's in his late 60s but uses the "I'm old" excuse like he in his 80s), and he kept trying to put the tv on (when we said no more tv) so our boys would leave their playroom and some sit in the living room with him.

The worst part is watching my kids notice the difference as they get older. My 7-year-old has started asking why Grandma and Grandpa [my parents] always want to play but the other grandparents just watch TV. It's heartbreaking honestly.

I’ve always gotten sick more often here than anywhere else!! Also it comes on super fast and SUPER hard, I get things like body aches and weakness that I never get anywhere else 🥲 for context I grew up in south Florida for 18 years, but I’ve lived here for 4 years now so I thought I would get used to new germs.. also I do take vitamin supplements so (?) not sure why it keeps happening 😭 anyone else feel this? 

Reddit author comment: If it makes you feel better, I also moved here from Florida at about the same time (about a year earlier give or take) and I’m probably about the same amount of sick as I was then, or maybe a little less. I hang out in large groups and go to concerts less often than I did in FL. But, the past year as my kid has entered into school, I’ve been getting way more sick. 

So, it’s likely because you’re in college now as the main culprit. Drinking (if you are), lack of sleep, weakened immune system from COVID, as others have mentioned, are going to play a factor, too. But, at the end of the day, if you are constantly exposed to more illnesses than you were before, you’re going to get sick more often.

I'll wake up feeling fine and by noon I'm practically bedridden with the most intense body aches and fatigue. I've talked to my doctor about it and they mentioned that different regions can have different viral strains that your immune system isn't familiar with, plus environmental factors like humidity, air quality, and even altitude can play a role.

Moving to a new place can really mess with your immune system, especially if the climate, allergens, or local microbes are different from what your body’s used to. South Florida has a pretty unique environment—hot, humid, and with a specific set of seasonal illnesses—so your immune system might still be reacting strongly to new germs or allergens where you are now. Also, sometimes vitamin supplements help, but they’re not a magic fix for adapting to a new ecosystem. Have you tried seeing a local doctor to check for things like mold allergies or chronic sinus issues? Sometimes those can make you feel extra sick and weak.

In my case, I've noticed that I get sick more often during the winter months when the air is drier and the sun is scarce, which can weaken my immune system. Additionally, I've found that my diet plays a crucial role in my overall health, and consuming foods high in sugar and processed ingredients can make me more susceptible to illnesses. Therefore, I would recommend exploring these factors and making adjustments to your lifestyle to see if it makes a difference.

Post: How are your pregnancy hormones affecting you emotionally / mentally?
Currently 20 weeks, and throughout pregnancy I've noticed my hormones will sometimes amp up for a day or two and have some strange effects. Yesterday, for example, I spent most of the day feeling like I was looking at the world through a distorted fun house mirror. Everything felt sinister, scary, sad, etc. Even my husband felt like a stranger in my own house and I couldn't look at him too long or else it freaked me out. I knew it was hormones and felt a bit better after taking my focus off how I felt and just doing practical things to take care of myself, but it was super uncomfortable. I have a therapist and am no stranger to navigating mental health challenges, but days like yesterday make me nervous for the PP period. 

Today, I feel totally back to normal, and the day before yesterday, I was super happy and content despite dealing with a cold. The emotional whiplash is truly something.

I also started keeping a mood journal to track patterns, which helped me feel more in control. The fact that you bounced back to normal the next day is actually really encouraging for postpartum - it shows your brain is still regulating, just with some wild swings. I talked to my OB about it and she said these intense but short-lived episodes are actually pretty common in the second trimester when hormone levels are fluctuating rapidly.

It’s good that you have a therapist and are proactive about your mental health; that support is so important.

I also found it helpful to talk to my partner and loved ones about what I was going through, so they could understand and support me better.

It's like being on an emotional roller coaster, and you never know which ride you're going to get each day. I found it really helpful to talk about it with my partner and friends who were also pregnant. Just knowing that others were going through similar things made it a bit easier to handle. I also started journaling, which was a great way to process my feelings and see the patterns. It's good to have a therapist to lean on, and I think continuing that support after the baby is born will be crucial.

Post: Can last player really catch up in Joyride?
I want to buy this game but I’m worried about runaway leader problem. I have looked at BGG forum and I understand the catch up mechanic is there (refresh power up and map matters). But I watched some play through and in those videos, the last player stays last.

Skill issue is definitely part of the formula. It’s useless if you don’t know to use those catch up mechanic strategically. So can anyone share past experience with the game where last player of the game eventually catch up to the leader? 

I never played a racing game (except El Dorado with a bad experience) so I don’t have much experience, but I guess that is an inherently element in racing game and it’s impossible to remove it completely. Is there a racing game where everyone can potentially at all time? 


Reddit author comment: Depends on the map and number of players. More players means more likely to have your line contested and more easily in the way of someone else to Rear-End or Side-Swipe you. 

We played 4 player a few weeks ago on a large double map with rainbow bridge connector, and first got spun out at 3rd checkpoint and never got back to first, but we all were at 5th checkpoint and near final checkpoint. Last player was not gonna win but did his best to maneuver to be a blockade of sorts, dropping an oil slick and mine to make passing final checkpoint more difficult. 

Had one of the 1st or 2nd player pushed their luck too far, he might have been able to claw back a victory, but they rolled well. 

1 v 1, it is much harder to catch up (unless you are using 2 cars each) but the races have always been close at least. 

You can adjust this by making the abilities recharge when you acquire items or simply pass a checkpoint (if you want so chaos) but again, depending on the track, # of players and the items in the game it can vary.

TL;DR I have Turbo edition and love the game, had a blast each time at all player counts. ... score: 0.61569

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've played Joyride probably 15+ times now with different groups, and honestly the catchup mechanics work better than most racing games I've tried. The key thing people miss in those playthroughs is that being last isn't automatically bad - you get way more powerup refreshes and can often take completely different routes that the leaders can't access anymore. I've seen players go from dead last on lap 2 to winning by the final stretch multiple times. The trick is understanding when to burn your good powerups versus saving them, and recognizing which alternate paths give you the best shortcuts. That said, if someone is genuinely making poor strategic decisions throughout the game, no amount of rubber banding will save them. The catchup mechanics reward smart play, they don't just hand you free wins. As for racing games where everyone stays competitive, check out Heat: Pedal to the Metal - the stress system there creates really dynamic positioning throughout the race. ... score: 0.59632

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I’ve played Joyride a handful of times, and I totally get what you’re worried about. In my experience, the catch-up mechanic is definitely there, but it’s not a “magic bullet”—if someone builds a big lead AND plays well, it can still be tough to reel them in. That said, I’ve seen the last player make a comeback, especially when they manage their power-ups smartly and the map offers them some optimal routes. The thing with Joyride is that it rewards good decisions but doesn’t punish mistakes so harshly that you can’t recover. I’d say it’s more forgiving than El Dorado, which can be super punishing if you fall behind. Also, table dynamics matter: if people focus on the leader or block routes, it can help the last-place player. So yeah, catching up is possible, but you do have to play your cards right! ... score: 0.62199

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I’ve played Joyride a bunch and I can say the catch-up mechanics definitely exist, but they’re subtle and situational. The power-ups and map layout give the last place player some chances to close the gap, especially if the leader gets a bit careless or uses their resources inefficiently. However, it’s not a guaranteed comeback every game. The skill element is huge—knowing when to trigger power-ups and which routes to take can make or break your race. Also, the randomness of power-up draws means sometimes the last player gets screwed and sometimes they get lucky. So yeah, last place can catch up, but it takes strategic play and a bit of luck. ... score: 0.59316

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I completely understand your concern about the runaway leader problem in Joyride, and it's great that you're doing your research before buying the game. As someone who has played Joyride multiple times, I can share some insights on the catch-up mechanics. While it's true that the last player may struggle to catch up, I've seen instances where a well-timed refresh power-up or a cleverly navigated map can significantly close the gap. However, it's also important to note that skill plays a huge role in utilizing these mechanics effectively. In my experience, the key to catching up is not just about using the catch-up mechanics, but also about understanding the game's strategy and making smart decisions throughout the game. For example, knowing when to take risks and when to play it safe can make a huge difference. Additionally, the game's design allows for multiple paths to victory, so even if one player is leading, others can still find ways to catch up by exploiting different strategies. That being said, I do agree that the runaway leader problem can be frustrating, especially for new players. But with experience and practice, I believe that Joyride offers a fun and challenging experience for players of all skill levels. ... score: 0.61742

The refresh power-up can be a game-changer if used correctly, especially when combined with a well-timed map strategy. I've seen games where the last player catches up and even wins, but it's not a given. It depends on how well everyone plays and how they use the catch-up mechanics.

The nature of racing games is that someone is usually ahead, but the fun is in the chase and the strategies you use to catch up. ... score: 0.50719

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I completely understand your concern! In my experience with Joyride, the catch-up mechanics do work, but they require some strategic thinking. The key is in the use of the refresh power-up and the layout of the map. For example, if you're in last place, try to use the refresh power-up when you're in a section of the map where you can take advantage of a shortcut or a boost pad. This can give you a significant speed boost and help you close the gap with the leaders. Additionally, the game's design often forces players to make choices that can benefit those who are behind. For instance, taking a more direct but slower route might seem like a good idea, but it can leave you vulnerable to being overtaken by players who take a riskier but faster path. I've seen games where the last player made a dramatic comeback, especially in the final laps. It's not a guaranteed fix, but with the right strategy, it's definitely possible. Just be patient, observe the map, and use your power-ups wisely. You might be surprised at how quickly the tables can turn! ... score: 0.63346

Post: Last classes were today and students added me on social media
Today was the last day of classes and 2 of my favorite students requested to follow me on Instagram. Completely great and mature kids and I want to accept the requests, but I feel like the smart move is to wait till they graduate (they just finished 9th grade). Any advice on how to handle this? This is my first year of teaching and haven't handled this so far. 

Reddit author comment: You could take my approach and just not have social media. I've gotten rid of my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and LinkedIn, and can't say my life is noticeably worse for having done so; Facebook is nice to find out what happened to the people wmyoi went to high school with, but then you eventually realize why you weren't friends with everyone, anyway. Plus, these companies make money on any data you give them, data which compromises your personal privacy, lets companies engage in differential pricing and marketing, and has the power to sway elections (at least, if we believe the social research that's trickling out, now).

So, to my mind, the easiest answer to them asking is "I don't have it, here's why," because you not only answer the question in a way they can't wheedle in, but start a conversation about an important issue they probably never thought of.

Social media can get messy - you might see posts about parties, drama between students, or even just typical teenage stuff that could put you in an awkward position later. What I usually do is tell students something like "I'd love to connect after you graduate! Hit me up then and we can follow each other." Most kids totally understand and respect that boundary.

Even if they’re mature, there are still professional boundaries to consider, and school policies (and parents!) can get really particular about this kind of thing.

Post: Black Lotus Mitigations Testing
I've been working on testing the mitigations for a week, working off of Microsoft's documentation.  I have tried performing the steps on the last 4 generations of laptops that we have and it won't work on any of them.  No entries in the event logs.  It just doesn't apply it and the registry key is changed back to zero after a reboot.  I've tested on an HP Elitebook g6, g7, g8, and g9 so far.  All have the latest firmware and Windows updates.  Has anyone else been having issues?

Reddit author comment: Am I missing something here?  MS is going to force these changes at some point within the next 12 months which could result in bricking a portion of devices.  As stated in the CVE article, "**CAUTION** After the mitigation for this issue is enabled on a device, meaning the mitigations have been applied, it cannot be reverted if you continue to use Secure Boot on that device. Even reformatting of the disk will not remove the revocations if they have already been applied."  No one seems to be worried about this.  I know that we can turn off secure boot, but that isn't a great option and I'd hate to have to do that to 500 computers in a really short time frame.   

To be clear, we aren't worried about Black Lotus, we are just trying to make sure that Microsoft's enforcement of the mitigation isn't going to brick half our laptops.  I'm finding contradicting information out there regarding how and when they plan on rolling this out.  Personally I think it's ridiculous that MS doesn't plan to release this as an OOB optional update.  So in the meantime, I'm fighting with getting this working just to hedge our bets that MS won't screw this up. ... score: 0.62309

What's really frustrating is that Microsoft's documentation makes it seem like this should be straightforward, but clearly there are some compatibility issues they haven't fully addressed.

Also, some OEMs might have their own customizations that interfere with Microsoft's default mitigation behavior. Have you tried testing on a clean Windows install or different hardware vendors?

The show was definitely interesting with its characters and bizarre setting, but that ending...just kinda left this empty feeling inside me. I don't think I felt this way since "Angel Beats". 

Also can someone explain how Nozami "died" in episode 10? Like why couldn't Asakaze use his power right there!? I was so confused!

Reddit author comment: I wasn’t a huge fan of Sonny Boy personally. I respect what it was going for, but it just felt kind of “hollow”, for lack of a better term. While I think the ideas it was trying to tackle were interesting, once you “get” that this is all just a metaphor for the confusion of growing up and entering the wider world you realize that there really isn’t much else to it. The story, world and characters are all incredibly vague and ill defined, and while this may be intentional, it still leads to it being difficult to give much of a shit about any of the characters or anything that happens. 

Finally, the ending was just incredibly unsatisfying in my opinion. The defense of this is  usually “it was supposed to be unsatisfying”.

Throughout the series, we see hints that using abilities comes with a cost, and Nozomi had been pushing herself to her limits. Asakaze couldn't save her because by that point, she had already made her choice to sacrifice herself. His power has limitations too - he can't just reverse any death, especially when it's tied to someone's power/essence like that.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from. Sonny Boy is one of those shows that feels intentionally ambiguous, and the ending in particular is super open to interpretation. That empty feeling you mention is something a lot of viewers felt, myself included. It’s kind of similar to "Angel Beats" in that it’s more about the journey and the emotions rather than tying everything up in a neat bow. As for Nozomi in episode 10, it’s a bit tricky. From what I understood, her "death" wasn’t a typical physical death—it’s more like she lost her "possibility" to continue existing in that world. Asakaze couldn’t save her because, at that point, the rules of the world had shifted and his power wasn’t absolute anymore. The show plays a lot with the idea that some things are just out of your control, no matter how much power you think you have. It’s frustrating, but also kind of beautiful in its own way. ... score: 0.69747

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from with the ending of *Sonny Boy*. It’s one of those shows that doesn’t give you neat, wrapped-up answers and instead leaves a lot of things open to interpretation, which can definitely leave you feeling empty or even frustrated. The surreal vibe throughout the series builds up this strange atmosphere where reality feels fluid, and then the ending kind of doubles down on that. I think the point was more about the characters’ emotional journeys and how they cope with isolation and change rather than delivering a traditional plot resolution. As for Nozami’s “death,” I interpreted it as a metaphorical or existential kind of death rather than a physical one. Asakaze’s powers might have limits tied to emotional or mental states rather than just being able to reverse anything on command.

I felt the same way after finishing it, and I think it's because the show does a great job of making you invest in the characters and their struggles. The world they're in is so unique and fascinating, and the way the story unfolds is both captivating and unsettling at the same time. I think the reason why you're feeling empty is because the show doesn't give you a clear resolution or a traditional happy ending, which can be frustrating for some viewers. As for Nozami's "death" in episode 10, I think it's because Asakaze's power has its limitations, and it's not something that can be used to bring people back from the dead. The show does a good job of explaining the rules of the world and the characters' abilities, but sometimes it's easy to get confused.

"Sonny Boy" had so many layers and intricate character development, but that final episode just felt like it didn't tie everything together neatly. It's one of those endings that leaves you with more questions than answers, and it's a bit frustrating. I think the show was trying to leave things open to interpretation, but it just didn't land for me. As for Nozami's "death," it's a bit of a plot twist. Asakaze's power is limited by his own emotional state and the bonds he shares with others. In that moment, he was overwhelmed by his own grief and the weight of the situation, which might have hindered his ability to use his power effectively.

Post: Granular convection : when shaking, the largest of irregularly shaped particles end up on the surface of a granular material containing a mixture of variously sized objects. Why is it unsolved??
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular\_convection#Explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granular_convection#Explanation)

Each of those explanations sound similar. And that is what I explained to myself after observing this effect with food.

Why is it still unsolved??

Is there a deviation in prediction??

Reddit author comment: Welcome to the world of soft matter physics, where the problems sound easy but no one can solve them. The explanations you linked to are nice stories, but the difficulty comes when you try to make a precise mathematical statement.

I am not an expert in granular media, but my understanding is that these problems are difficult because the systems are amorphous and athermal. Amorphous means there’s no regular structure to rely on like a crystalline solid, and athermal means the particles are too big to jiggle around due to temperature. This combination creates rough energy landscapes with many local minima to get trapped in.

This is all related to what physicists call “glasses”, and in particular I would call this a problem in “structural glasses”. Giorgio Parisi won the Nobel prize a few years ago for his work on (spin) glasses, and the 2025 APS Onsager prize was awarded to Leticia Cugliandolo, Jorge Kurchan, and Jean-Philippe Bouchard for their work on aging in glasses.

All this to say that everyday items, like a jar of mixed nuts, can hide some of our universe’s most difficult problems. ... score: 0.6168

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: The reason granular convection remains "unsolved" isn't because we don't understand the basic mechanisms - as you noted, the explanations are pretty consistent. The issue is that it's an incredibly complex multi-body problem with chaotic dynamics. While we can explain the general principles (size segregation due to void filling, density differences, geometric effects), predicting exactly how it will behave in specific situations is extremely difficult. Think about it - you have thousands or millions of particles, each with different shapes, sizes, densities, and surface properties, all interacting simultaneously under varying forces and frequencies. The mathematics becomes intractable very quickly. We can model simplified versions, but real-world granular materials are messy. Different grain shapes, moisture content, electrostatic forces, and vibration patterns all affect the outcome in ways that are hard to predict precisely. It's similar to turbulence in fluids - we understand the underlying physics, but the complexity makes exact predictions nearly impossible. ... score: 0.59048

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Great question! I think the main reason granular convection (often called the Brazil nut effect) is still considered "unsolved" is because there are so many variables at play, and the phenomenon is more complex than it first appears. The basic idea that larger particles end up on top when you shake a container is easy to observe and explain qualitatively, but when scientists try to make precise, quantitative predictions—like how fast the particles rise, or how they interact in differently shaped or sized containers—the models start to break down. Factors like particle shape, friction, air resistance, and even humidity can all affect the outcome, making it difficult to develop a single, unified theory that accurately predicts what will happen under all conditions. So while we have a general understanding, the devil's in the details, and that's where the "unsolved" part comes in. ... score: 0.56787

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This is a fascinating phenomenon because it seems so intuitive—shake a container and the biggest pieces rise to the top—but the underlying physics are surprisingly complex. The problem is that granular materials don’t behave like solids, liquids, or gases; they have characteristics of all three, which makes modeling them really challenging. Each explanation you read tries to capture different aspects, like percolation of smaller particles downward, convection currents inside the mix, or geometric constraints causing the larger particles to move upward. The reason it’s still “unsolved” is that no single theory perfectly predicts the behavior under all conditions—particle shape, friction, container shape, shaking intensity—all influence the outcome. Plus, experimental results sometimes contradict each other depending on those variables, so researchers are still trying to reconcile these discrepancies. ... score: 0.56359

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a physicist, I've always been fascinated by the phenomenon of granular convection, where the largest particles in a mixture of irregularly shaped objects rise to the surface when shaken. The Wikipedia article provides a good overview of the current understanding of this phenomenon, but I agree that the explanations seem similar and don't fully capture the complexity of the issue. One reason why granular convection remains unsolved is that it involves the interaction of multiple particles with different sizes, shapes, and properties, making it difficult to model and predict the behavior of the system. Additionally, the role of friction, gravity, and other external factors can significantly affect the outcome, leading to a high degree of variability and unpredictability. To make progress on this problem, researchers need to develop more sophisticated models and experimental techniques that can capture the intricate dynamics of granular systems. ... score: 0.53446

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Interesting phenomenon! Granular convection is indeed a complex process that's not fully understood yet.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: This is a fascinating phenomenon, and it's surprising that it remains unsolved. From my understanding, the challenge lies in the complexity of the interactions between the particles. Each particle's shape, size, and frictional properties play a significant role, and these factors can vary widely. Additionally, the dynamics of the system are highly nonlinear, making it difficult to predict the behavior of the particles under different conditions. It's not just about the largest particles rising to the top; there are subtle interactions and collective behaviors that are not yet fully understood. The lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework that can account for all these variables is likely why it remains an open question in physics. ... score: 0.57192

I haven't practiced calligraphy in a year or so, maybe more. I decided to pick it up again and this is the first time I am doing it on this medication, and my hand tremors affect my ability to create thin upstrokes. It doesn't affect my normal handwriting because I write quickly, but when I am trying to do something fine and slow, the tremors are very noticeable in the upstrokes.

You can also experiment with different pen weights; sometimes a slightly heavier pen can provide more stability. Consider trying brush pens or markers instead of traditional nibs, as they're more forgiving with slight variations in pressure and movement.
