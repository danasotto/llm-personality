Post: Have you ever dreamt of conducting an experiment with no limits? 
Do you have a wild theory that breaks the boundaries of conventional thinking?   
  
There's a conference in October that is inviting folks to share their boldest ideas. It's called *Extreme Experiments & Unhinged Hypotheses*—a lightning round of 5-minute talks where imagination reigns supreme. 

The conference is appropriately named the Zombie Apocalypse Medicine Meeting (ZAMM), and looks to share complex topics about the future of humanity...but through the lens of the zombie apocalypse, as the name suggests. It's imaginative and radically interdisciplinary bridging science and the arts to grapple with the most pressing challenges of the present and the future. This year's meeting focuses on the ways humans manage apocalyptic risks, especially through cooperation, storytelling, entertainment and play, and I can't help but imagine incorporating these ideas into our theories about the future. The goal of ZAMM, as stated on the website, is to reduce the global burden of zombification and contribute to apocalypse prevention and preparedness through interdisciplinary engagement.  
  
While we might not all show up at this conference (though it would fascinating if we had a reddit takeover at this event, with wild theories flying around) I'm curious-- If you had a chance to present radical, out-of-the-box research designs, speculative theories, or experimental frameworks that defy constraints, what would you be interested in talk about? It could be a study too ambitious to fund, a concept so daring it might just work, a theory on the cutting edge of science fiction...what would you talk about?

\*\*Not sure if I'm allowed to post links to more info on this conference, but I added the link to their main website. Remove if not allowed!

  


Reddit author comment: We should research into bio engineering trees that grow into multistory structures that can be turned into homes. Or maybe giant gourds.

It will gather moisture from the air to provide drinking water. The inside of a new room will be full of strong fibers that can be turned into textiles. The sap is a painkiller, antibiotic and fever reducer. It will grow sticky flowers that can be molded like fiberglass that hardens into ceramics when left in the sun. The thorns it grows can be sharpened and shaped and turned into blades or kitchen utensils. 

We will call them Houseplants. ... score: 0.32538

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This sounds absolutely fascinating! I've always been obsessed with the idea of conducting a massive longitudinal study on collective human behavior during resource scarcity - something that would obviously be completely unethical to actually implement, but perfect for a zombie apocalypse framework. My wild theory is that humans actually have an untapped "hive mind" capability that only emerges during extreme crisis situations, similar to how certain ant colonies can make complex decisions without centralized leadership. I'd want to design an experiment that tests whether isolated groups of survivors would independently develop similar survival strategies, communication methods, and social hierarchies when faced with identical zombie threats. The study would involve creating controlled "apocalypse scenarios" with different variables - urban vs rural settings, different group sizes, varying resource availability - and then tracking how quickly groups develop cooperative behaviors, leadership structures, and innovative solutions. I think we'd discover that humans have dormant collective intelligence mechanisms that our modern society has actually suppressed. The implications for everything from disaster preparedness to organizational psychology would be mind-blowing. Plus, framing it through zombies makes it way more engaging than dry academic papers about crisis management! ... score: 0.50505

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is such a cool concept! If I could present an unhinged hypothesis at ZAMM, I'd love to explore the idea of "memetic inoculation"—basically, can we vaccinate society against dangerous ideas (like those that lead to mass hysteria or apocalyptic cults) by deliberately exposing people to weakened, fictional versions of these memes, much like how vaccines work for viruses? Using storytelling, VR simulations, and collaborative world-building games, we could test whether exposure to fictional apocalypses (zombies or otherwise) helps people build cognitive resilience, critical thinking, and collective coping mechanisms for real-world crises. The experiment would involve tracking participants over time, seeing if their reactions to disinformation campaigns, panic-inducing news, or conspiracy theories are more measured after a "memetic vaccine." It would blend psychology, media studies, immunology (in a metaphorical sense), and even a bit of improv theater. I think this kind of radical, playful approach could reveal a lot about how narratives shape our survival instincts and societal cohesion. ... score: 0.5491

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This conference sounds like an absolute dream for anyone who loves pushing the boundaries of conventional thought! If I had the chance to present, I'd propose an experiment that blends neuroscience with immersive virtual reality to simulate a full-scale zombie outbreak scenario. Imagine mapping real-time brain activity and group dynamics as participants navigate moral dilemmas, survival decisions, and social cooperation under extreme stress. The goal would be to uncover how empathy and trust evolve—or collapse—when society is on the brink of apocalypse. This could have incredible implications for understanding human behavior in crisis and improving disaster response strategies.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and human consciousness. If I had a chance to present at ZAMM, I would propose an experiment where we explore the creation of a symbiotic relationship between AI and the human brain. Imagine a future where AI can not only augment our cognitive abilities but also help us navigate and mitigate the effects of a zombie apocalypse. For instance, an AI system could predict zombie movements, optimize resource allocation, and even help in the development of a cure. The experiment would involve creating a small, wearable device that can interface with the brain, allowing for real-time data exchange and decision-making support. The ethical implications would be vast, but the potential benefits in terms of human resilience and adaptability could be monumental. Plus, it would be a fascinating way to explore how we can use technology to enhance our survival in extreme scenarios, while also pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human in a post-apocalyptic world. I think this kind of research could not only be a game-changer for ZAMM but also spark new discussions in the broader scientific community about the future of AI and human collaboration. I'd love to hear what others think about this idea and any feedback on the feasibility or ethical considerations! ... score: 0.49648

Post: (Update) Recognize these guys? They came home with me yesterday
I learned about these guys through this subreddit and fell in love. Apparently they had been in foster care almost their entire lives. I'm so excited to get to know them more. They're already warming up to me (I got a stern thump when I pet them the first time, but they're starting to come up to me and they let me pet them a lot now).

Tell me your rabbit's favorite food, I'm figuring out what they like! My first rabbits went mad for bananas, so I had those as treats/bribes for their first evening, but these two are completely ambivalent!

Reddit author comment: I remember this post! I have 4 buns who live the high life, but I still tried to talk my partner into adopting them. I’m so glad they got a good home!! 🖤 

My rabbits go absolutely ham for carrot greens. If you’re in a space that you can plant carrots, they will flower, they will go to seed, and they will litter your entire space with more carrots. We walk out back and pluck a handful of carrots, give them a little carrot each, and then make them a pile of the greens. They love it and carrots are so self maintaining once planted, it’s a perfect system. 

Good luck with the new bbs! Please give them pats and scritchies for me. ... score: 0.36947

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh my goodness, congratulations on your new bunnies! The fact that they're already coming up to you and letting you pet them is such a great sign - rabbits can be so cautious at first, especially ones who have been in foster care for a while. That initial thump was probably just them saying "hey, who are you?!" but it sounds like they're quickly realizing you're their new favorite human. As for favorite foods, my Holland Lop absolutely goes CRAZY for fresh cilantro - like, she'll literally do backflips when she hears me rustling the cilantro bag. She also loves apple slices (just a small piece as a treat), and surprisingly, she's obsessed with the leafy tops of carrots more than the actual carrot itself. Some other hits in my house are small pieces of strawberry, fresh parsley, and romaine lettuce.

She’ll turn her nose up at banana and apple but will quite literally climb into my lap if I have a handful of dill.

My rabbit was super picky at first too, but eventually, I discovered that fresh herbs like parsley and cilantro were a huge hit. Also, some rabbits really enjoy crunchy veggies like bell peppers or carrot tops rather than carrot pieces themselves.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm beyond thrilled to see you've adopted not one, but two rabbits! I had a similar experience with my rabbit, Luna, who was also a foster care rabbit, and I totally understand the initial hesitation they have towards humans. It's completely normal, and it's amazing how quickly they can warm up to us once they feel safe and loved. As for favorite foods, Luna absolutely loves fresh veggies like carrots, bell peppers, and cucumbers. She's particularly fond of timothy hay, which I make sure to provide in abundance. I've also found that rabbits have different preferences when it comes to fruits, so it's not surprising that your new friends aren't too keen on bananas. Perhaps you could try introducing them to other fruits like apples, berries, or even melons? Remember to always introduce new foods gradually and in small amounts to prevent digestive upset.

Post: What’s a good 1.5 Weeks New England itinerary for the summer?
As the title states, I am looking for some itinerary/ ideas for visiting New England for a week and a half in the summer. 

I’m looking to site see, go on hikes/ enjoy outdoors, and eat good food. 

I know I won’t be able to see all 6 states but I would like to see Massachusetts, Rhode Island, andd I’m not sure what else I should try to fit -  open to many ideas :) 

Reddit author comment: Here’s what we did a few years ago and enjoyed it- it was a bit rushed so hopefully with your week and a half yours might not need to be so rushed.

Day 1-2 Portland, ME. Highlights were stopping in Kennebunkport for lunch, Cape Elizabeth, sunset lighthouse boat tour, Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens, LL Bean store, Fore Street restaurant.

Day 3-5 Boston, MA. Did most of the standard tourist things- Freedom trail, Red Sox game, Harvard tour, etc.

Days 5-7 Cape Cod, MA (Falmouth). We loved the shining sea bike trail and checking out the beaches, wineries, and restaurants in the area. 

Would highly recommend including Maine on your trip if you can- it was our favorite! I wish we had been able to go to Bar Harbor & Acadia National Park but it wasn’t in the cards for us that trip! ... score: 0.35607

Post: Finding a hobby is a pain when you're poor and have ADHD.
Reading?.  Gotta be something that is a page turner.

Walking and hiking?.  I walk enough each day that it doesn't seem that magical.  As for hiking, it's gotta have an abundance of rare wildlife or I'm bored.

Rock collecting? Meh..

Collecting action figures?.  RIGHT ON!!!....but I'm poor.

Playing something awesome like Saxophone?.  AWESOME!......but, same response as above.

Seems my ADHD brain moves so fast that the only hobbies that would keep my attention and thrill, cost a considerable amount of money.

Anyone else's brain move faster than a hobby can keep up?. 

Reddit author comment: I finally have my hyperfixations... not controlled, not even managed, but... in rotation?

I like being outdoors.  Hunting, fishing, trapping, hiking, camping, backpacking, canoeing, boating, etc.  

The good news is that just as one is losing its luster, it's a new season.  Right now it is ice fishing season.  I'll be good with that just long enough for it to become trout fly fishing season.  Then it'll be turkey season.  Then pike season..Then it'll be bass season. Next will be coyote hunting season.  Then deer season.  Then trapping season.  Then back to ice fishing season.  All of these are intertwined with hiking, camping, backpacking and canoeing/boating.

For you  I would suggest fishing.  You can get an ultralight rod and reel combo, tackle box, hooks, weights, and lures to get you going at a big box for $100 or less.  Can't spring the $100?  Go to yard sales.  They are always full of old rods and reels for cheap.  Hell, get a sturdy branch, a string (or dental floss), make a hook from a soda can tab, and bait with a worm, bug, or even a piece of bread or hotdog.  Even then the sturdy branch is optional.

Find some public fishing access online with your fish and game agency.  Have at it.  

Then as money comes available, you can branch out into various types of fishing.  Varied by target species and equipment type.  You can fish for trout a bunch of different ways.  Spinning rod, fly rod, ice fishing, wading, drifting, creeks, rivers, ponds, wet fly, dry fly, live bait, artificial bait, and more.  And there are different trout species to go after.  Brookies, rainbows, brown, Lakers, bull trout, palomino, and plenty more.

And we haven't even mentioned saltwater. ... score: 0.41605

The hunt for something specific might give you that thrill. Also, check Facebook Marketplace and thrift stores religiously for action figures - I've found some amazing deals there.

Post: What is it like being a vet? I have heard mixed things...
Hello!

I'm 16 and am currently ooking for careers and colleges. I have a couple questions though as a career as a vet is my top pick right now.

1) What is it like being a vet? I have heard everything from it's amazing, and as bad as "The career has the highest suicide rate of any profession.

2) Do I NEED to get an undergrad? Can I just go straight to vet school?



Reddit author comment: Basically, you want to make sure your choices match your personality and skills, so I, too, would suggest volunteering/working as an assistant before taking a decision.

As you may have read on many posts, veterinary medicine surprisingly involves a lot of interaction with (sometimes difficult) people/clients, and many colleagues have found that to be an obstacle to fully enjoying their profession. 

Nevertheless, veterinary medicine can be a very fulfilling career. You will read a lot, you will learn a lot, you will meet wonderful (and not so wonderful) colleagues AND you will experience the joy of seeing a patient recover. ... score: 0.36682

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! I'm a small animal vet who's been practicing for about 8 years now, so I can give you some real talk about this profession. The truth is, both things you've heard are kind of accurate - it can be incredibly rewarding AND incredibly challenging. The suicide rate thing is unfortunately real, and it stems from a combination of factors: crushing student debt (I graduated with $180k in loans), emotional burnout from euthanizing animals regularly, dealing with angry clients who think you're just trying to rip them off, and the pressure of making life-or-death decisions daily. BUT, and this is a big but, there are also days where you save a puppy's life, help an elderly person's cat feel better, or successfully perform a surgery that gives an animal years more with their family. The key is going into it with realistic expectations and strong mental health support. As for your second question - yes, you absolutely need an undergrad degree first. Vet school is a graduate program, typically 4 years after your bachelor's. Most people do pre-vet tracks with lots of science courses. My advice? Volunteer at local vet clinics NOW to see if you can handle the reality of the job before committing to 8+ years of education. ... score: 0.54187

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Hey! As someone who has a couple of close friends in veterinary medicine, I can share some insight. Being a vet is definitely a mixed bag. On the one hand, it's incredibly rewarding to help animals and their families, and you get to work with a wide variety of creatures, which can be really exciting. On the other hand, it can be very emotionally and physically draining. You have to deal with difficult cases, euthanasia, and sometimes tough clients. The high suicide rate you mentioned is unfortunately true, and a lot of it is due to stress, long hours, and sometimes unrealistic expectations from pet owners. As for your second question, yes, you absolutely need an undergraduate degree before applying to vet school in the US (and most places). Vet school is extremely competitive, so having a strong undergrad record, lots of animal experience, and good recommendations are all must-haves.

On a daily basis, I get to interact with a wide range of animals, from dogs and cats to horses and even the occasional exotic pet. There's nothing quite like the feeling of helping an animal recover from an illness or injury, and seeing the joy on the owner's face when they're reunited with their beloved pet. However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows - the work can be emotionally demanding, and there are times when you have to deal with difficult clients or make tough decisions about an animal's care. Despite these challenges, I can honestly say that I love my job and wouldn't trade it for anything. In terms of the suicide rate, it's true that the veterinary profession has a higher rate of mental health issues and burnout, but I believe that this is largely due to the high levels of stress and pressure that come with the job, rather than the job itself. With the right support and self-care, I believe that it's possible to maintain a healthy work-life balance and thrive in this career.

Post: What should I plant between my neighbors driveway and mine to create a divide?
Over the summer I pulled out some overgrown bushes that used to be between my neighbors driveway and mine. I'm looking to redo the entire section this spring, but I'm not sure what I should put here. I'm in zone 6a. My property is about 4 feet of this grass here (although I've spoken to the neighbors and they've said they don't care if I cross over into their yard)

My mom suggested some emerald green arborvitaes, and I like the idea, but I worry they'd be much to large for the area when they mature. 

Reddit author comment: 3 blue arrow junipers closer to the house end of the driveway. They get about 12 feet high and 2 feet wide. Then, some smaller shrubs that you can see over as you get closer to the end of the driveway. Maybe a few hydrangeas or a smaller growing smoke bush, you don't want them to top off too high so you can see if people are walking on the sidewalk.Or maybe some native wildflowers going down the rest of the driveway.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I'd actually recommend against arborvitae for that narrow space - your mom's heart is in the right place, but those emerald greens can get 12-15 feet tall and 4-5 feet wide at maturity, which would definitely overwhelm a 4-foot strip. Instead, consider some alternatives that would work better long-term. For evergreen screening, you might look into dwarf varieties like 'Hetz Midget' arborvitae which stays under 4 feet, or consider a mixed planting approach. Boxwood could work well - varieties like 'Green Velvet' or 'Green Mountain' stay compact and provide year-round structure. You could also do a layered approach with some ornamental grasses like fountain grass or feather reed grass for height, underplanted with shorter shrubs like spirea or potentilla. Another option would be a formal hedge of privet or forsythia that you can keep trimmed to whatever height works best. The key is choosing plants that either naturally stay small or respond well to pruning so you don't end up regretting your choice in 10 years when everything's overgrown again. ... score: 0.45212

Another option to consider is boxwood or a dwarf variety of holly, both of which are evergreen and much more manageable in tight spaces. You could also do a mix of ornamental grasses and perennials—something like Karl Foerster feather reed grass for vertical interest, with low-growing flowering plants at the base.

Post: Which chemistry set would you recommend?
I am a non-professional chemist and I am looking for a set of chemicals. About six years ago I got a chemistry kit. I have the equipment, however I don't have many chemicals. Idealy, I would want a kit of chemicals, that aren't in big quantities (such as 1kg) and I can do interesting experiments with them. Can you recommend a chemistry set? 

Thanks in advance!

Reddit author comment: My chemistry set consists of Amazon, aliexpress, ebay, walmart, canadian tire, home depot.... And a credit card.

"Interesting" really depends on what you want to do. To me, what's more important than the physical chemicals is the knowledge of how to get a reaction out of them. I pick a reaction i want to do, say make sodium metal, and then i go find the chemicals for it. In my case drain cleaner, magnesium firestarters, baby oil, menthol crystals, and energizer batteries. Then with some time and effort, i turn that into sodium metal... which i then throw into a bucket of water and make them explode.

If you're looking around for chemistry sets, see if you can download and review the manual first. That's the real gem of the set. See if the experiments are interesting and the kinds you want to do.

Alternatively, don't even get the set, see if you can source the individual chemicals domestically, thats a whole adventure in itself.

They sell chemicals in much more reasonable amounts (like 25g-100g bottles) which is perfect for home experimentation. For interesting experiments, I'd suggest getting basics like copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium carbonate, citric acid, and some indicator solutions. You could also look into **Carolina Biological Supply** - they have educational chemical sets that come with smaller quantities specifically designed for demonstrations and experiments. Another great option is **Flinn Scientific**, though they primarily sell to educators, you might be able to purchase through them if you explain your educational interest.

Post: Daily transaction cryptocurrency
Hi all, 

   It seems pretty clear (to me) that bitcoin is likely to be a store of wealth, analagous to gold. However, it seems unlikely it'll be used on people on street on a daily basis. So - what do you think is likely to be the "daily" cryptocurrency in the future? 

   Without wanting to be rude, I'm not looking for a sales pitch for your favourite alt / shit coin, I'd like to hear about the technical details that mean one coin is likely to pull ahead of the others in terms of daily usage or transactions. 

   I've always liked Ethereum but, at the same time, I'm aware that's not based on any particular knowledge. 

Thanks

Reddit author comment: any answer outside of stablecoins is wrong.


Tron is in the lead for being a chain used for regular usage(of USDT), other than that Solana is in the lead for general usage, and Ethereum is in the lead for stablecoin supply/liquidity.

Another factor I think is looking at which chains have partnered with or integrated other payment systems and what outside companies think about each chains capabilities, specifically primitives like token extensions on Solana. Solana has partnered with Worldpay, Shopify, Visa, and Paypal, with Paypal saying 



And you can see how someone like the State of Wyoming compares chains for their use with payments/stables and they also echo that sentiment:

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I think you're asking the right question here, and honestly, I don't think we have a clear winner yet for daily transactions. The technical requirements are pretty demanding: you need low fees (ideally under $0.01 per transaction), fast confirmation times (under 5 seconds for retail), high throughput (thousands of TPS), and most importantly, stability in both price and network performance. Bitcoin clearly fails on fees and speed. Ethereum is getting better with L2 solutions like Polygon and Arbitrum, but the user experience is still clunky for average consumers who don't want to deal with bridging and multiple wallets. I've been watching Solana closely because it has the technical specs (50k+ TPS, sub-second finality, fees under $0.01), but the network stability issues are concerning for daily use. ALGO and NANO also have impressive technical capabilities, but they lack the ecosystem and adoption. Honestly, I think the winner might be a CBDC or a stablecoin on a highly optimized network rather than any of the current "pure" cryptocurrencies. The technical hurdles are solvable, but the adoption and regulatory challenges might be the real determining factors. ... score: 0.43978

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Great question! I think you're spot-on about Bitcoin—its slow transaction speed, relatively high fees, and limited throughput make it unlikely for daily coffee purchases, especially compared to fiat or even credit cards. For daily use, key technical features matter: transaction speed (finality), low fees, scalability, and ease of integration. Coins like Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash were designed to be more transactional, but they don't seem to have hit mainstream traction. Lately, Layer 2 solutions (like Lightning Network for Bitcoin or zk-rollups for Ethereum) are getting a lot of attention, but they still have UX hurdles. Other contenders are coins like Nano (instant, feeless, but less adoption) or Solana (fast, low fees, but decentralization tradeoffs and past outages). I think the real answer may be a combination: Layer 2s on top of established blockchains, or maybe stablecoins like USDC on fast blockchains, since people want price stability. In the end, mass adoption will depend on user experience, regulatory clarity, and merchant integration as much as the tech! ... score: 0.4212

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Great question! When considering a cryptocurrency for daily transactions, scalability and transaction speed are key technical factors. Bitcoin, as you mentioned, is more like digital gold due to its slower block times and higher fees during congestion. Ethereum, while popular and versatile thanks to smart contracts, still struggles with high gas fees and network congestion, though Ethereum 2.0 and Layer 2 solutions like rollups are promising improvements. However, coins like Solana and Avalanche have gained attention for their high throughput and low fees, using different consensus mechanisms (Proof of History for Solana, Avalanche consensus for Avalanche) that allow thousands of transactions per second with near-instant finality. Additionally, stablecoins on these platforms could facilitate daily use by minimizing volatility. Ultimately, the winner for daily transactions will likely be a chain that balances decentralization with high-speed, low-cost transactions and strong developer support. ... score: 0.39684

However, there are other contenders like Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) that are also worth considering. Solana, for instance, has been praised for its high transaction speed and low fees, which are crucial for everyday transactions. Cardano, on the other hand, is known for its rigorous academic research and peer-reviewed approach, which could give it a solid foundation for widespread adoption.

Post: Is it worth reviving old projects?
Years ago, I built a Microsoft Paint clone using plain JavaScript and CSS. It was a fun little project, especially for nostalgia sake. But looking back, the code is a real mess, and it lacks modern features.

Now, I’m thinking of reviving it with better technologies (React, TypeScript...) and making it useful.  
l. Maybe even turning it into a web-based alternative to Paint.NET.

Do you think it’s worth the effort?

PS: here is the project [Link](https://github.com/salahkai/MS-PAINT/) if you're interested.

Reddit author comment: Programmer here. Yes, 100% worth it.

Don't even think about it as a "revival"... it's a re-write and a whole new edition (not just new version).

When I'm learning a new technology/language/framework I nearly always start by making a simple project that I've made before, only now using the new technology. It makes it so much easier to learn a new thing/tool/tech when you are 100% familiar with the project itself.

It also makes it easier to recognize how the new thing is different. You might find that the new technology now automates something you used to do manually every single time. You might not even notice that feature in the new tech, until you're actively building something.

React and TypeScript are great choices for modernizing your application. They will not only make the code more maintainable and scalable but also enhance the user experience significantly. Plus, there's a sense of nostalgia and personal connection that comes with reviving an old project. You’ve already got a solid foundation, so the transition won’t be as daunting as starting from scratch. Turning it into a web-based alternative to Paint.NET is a brilliant goal. It could attract a lot of users who are looking for a lightweight, easy-to-use, and feature-rich painting tool online. I’d definitely use it! Just make sure to break the project into manageable tasks and set realistic milestones. That way, you can stay motivated and avoid burnout.

Post: Can Arnis / Eskrima techniques be applied using forearms?
Would it be viable to adapt arnis/eskrima techniques to strike with the forearms (provided they are conditioned) instead of using a stick or knife? By viable I mean in empty hand combat. If it is viable, what martial arts should I learn along with that to supplement?

Reddit author comment: Why reinvent the wheel? There is going to be a variety of crossover to all martial arts, and depending on your skill level of interest, more or less. As being top elite in a specific competition will tend to reduce some crossover that works for generic training and a avg "foot soldier" level person. 


Just take any unarmed art that has functional reality and it'll all track well enough. You're not going to be a better fighter doing sword/stick strikes with your forearm, than if you know how to punch. 


Either take the associated art unarmed combat as FMA has. Or take like Muay Thai or another kickboxing. 


Or take Judo/BJJ and learn grappling, which translates great to real weapon fights and allows you to use strikes as set up/opener to the grappling. ... score: 0.3895

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely! This is actually a pretty common adaptation that many FMA practitioners explore. The biomechanics of stick and blade work translate surprisingly well to forearm strikes, especially the angles of attack and flow patterns. Your forearms essentially become your weapons, and the same 12 angles of attack in most Eskrima systems work great with forearm conditioning. However, you'll want to be careful about range - sticks give you extended reach that forearms obviously don't, so you'll need to adjust your distance management. For supplementary arts, I'd highly recommend Muay Thai for the clinch work and elbow techniques, plus some Panantukan (Filipino boxing) if you can find it, since it's specifically designed as the empty-hand component of FMA. Silat also pairs beautifully with this approach since it emphasizes similar flowing movements and limb destruction concepts. Just make sure you're conditioning your forearms properly - start light and build up gradually, or you'll end up with some nasty injuries that'll set back your training. ... score: 0.45223

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, a lot of Arnis/Eskrima techniques can be adapted to use the forearms, especially in empty hand combat scenarios. Many Filipino martial arts (FMA) systems have what’s called “panantukan” or “dirty boxing,” which is essentially the empty hand adaptation of their stick and blade movements. The motions you learn with a stick (angles, deflections, redirections) can be mirrored with your arms, and forearm strikes can be very effective, especially in close quarters. Forearm shots can be used for blocking, parrying, and striking (think hammerfist, ridge hand, or elbow-like motions). To supplement your training, you might want to look into Muay Thai for its clinch work and elbow/forearm strikes, or even boxing for its hand and arm mechanics. Kali/Arnis instructors who focus on the “empty hand” side of things (like Panantukan or Dumog) would be perfect, as they often bridge the gap between weapon and empty hand applications. Just make sure your forearms are conditioned properly to avoid injury! ... score: 0.47168

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Absolutely, adapting Arnis/Eskrima techniques to forearm strikes can be viable in empty-hand combat, especially if your forearms are well-conditioned. Traditional Arnis emphasizes weapon-based movement, angles, and timing, which can translate effectively to forearm strikes, blocks, and parries. The forearm can be used for powerful blocks, checks, and even offensive strikes, mimicking the stick’s linear motions but with added versatility since it’s part of your body. To supplement this, learning arts like Muay Thai for clinch work and conditioning, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for grappling transitions, and perhaps Filipino Martial Arts empty-hand systems like Panantukan (Filipino boxing) could round out your skill set. Panantukan specifically bridges the gap between weapon-based and empty-hand combat, focusing on similar angles, traps, and strikes with hands and forearms. Conditioning is key, so incorporating forearm strengthening exercises and impact conditioning drills would enhance the effectiveness. Overall, blending Eskrima principles with forearm strikes is not only viable but can create a unique and effective empty-hand fighting style. ... score: 0.43039

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the idea of adapting martial arts techniques to empty-hand combat, and using forearms in Arnis/Eskrima is an intriguing concept. The key to successfully applying these techniques would be to condition the forearms to withstand the impact, as well as to develop the proper technique and timing. It's essential to note that the forearms are not as durable as sticks or knives, so the strikes would need to be more precise and controlled. In terms of supplementing with other martial arts, I would recommend learning Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to improve grappling skills, as well as Muay Thai or Boxing to enhance striking techniques. By combining these martial arts, you could create a unique and effective fighting style that incorporates the principles of Arnis/Eskrima with the practicality of empty-hand combat. ... score: 0.41793

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Comment 1: While Arnis and Eskrima are traditionally stick and knife fighting styles, many of the principles can be adapted for empty-hand combat. The forearm strikes you're suggesting could be a viable option, especially if you're looking for a way to condition your arms. However, keep in mind that without the added reach and leverage of a weapon, the dynamics of combat change significantly. You'll need to focus on footwork, evasion, and grappling techniques to make up for the lack of a weapon. I suggest looking into Filipino martial arts that focus on empty-hand combat, like Panantukan or Dumog, to supplement your practice. ... score: 0.45041

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Forearm strikes can definitely be effective, but it's important to understand the biomechanics and risks involved. In Arnis/Eskrima, the stick serves as an extension of the arm, providing leverage and reach. When using your forearms, you lose some of that leverage, so you need to focus on generating power from your core and hips. I'd recommend checking out arts like Krav Maga or Systema, which both emphasize practical, no-nonsense techniques for self-defense. These systems can teach you how to deliver powerful strikes and defend against various attacks. Also, consider incorporating some boxing or kickboxing to improve your overall striking abilities and footwork. ... score: 0.44256

Post: What would you do with all this produce? Tomatoes and lettuce pretty fresh, the rest of it less so
Pictured: 3 artichokes of questionable freshness, 5 wrinkly eggplants, about 10 fresh tomatoes, about 10 decent potatoes, 3 heads of romaine lettuce, an onion, and a decent zucchini. It all needs to be used pretty soon though! I only have 3 people to feed, and it needs to be vegetarian. Help!

Reddit author comment: I'd turn the eggplant into [baba ganoush](https://www.loveandlemons.com/baba-ganoush/#wprm-recipe-container-43084).

I like potatoes roasted. I usually slice into wedges, toss with olive oil, and season with salt, garlic powder, and za'atar, roast at 400F for 40 minutes, flipping/stirring halfway through (I can and will eat the entire pan of these). You can also slice the onion fairly thin and add it to this, pretty tasty.

The tomatoes, you could slice them for a salad with the lettuce (or sandwiches) or cook them down into a soup or sauce.

Zucchini you could turn into [zucchini bread](https://www.budgetbytes.com/zucchini-bread/), or if you have the other ingredients, [these muffins](https://thecheekychickpea.com/vegan-morning-glory-muffins/) are SO GOOD and freeze well (I just microwave them for 45 seconds for 1, or 1:30 for 2 straight from the freezer but I'd start with 30 seconds for 1/ 1 minute for 2 and see)

Post: christmas vs thanksgiving dinner 
as a non american, i was curious, what really is the difference between traditional christmas dinner and traditional thanksgiving dinner? from what i have gathered, they seems to have pretty similar elements. a main dish, most commonly roasted turkey or sometimes chicken or ham, stuffing, gravy, beef wellington(?), side dishes usually involving foods like devilled eggs, mac n cheese, corn(cornbread or casserole), green beans (casserole), brussels sprouts(roasted), carrots(glazed), cranberries(cranberry sauce), (mashed) potatoes , desserts usually are pies- (apple, sweet potato, pecan, pumpkin..) so basically what im trying to say is, aren't they pretty much the same? or at least quite similar in terms of the flavour profiles/main ingredients, style of cooking, the 'format'/layout of the meal. there isnt a huge gap between thanksgiving and christmas, so i suppose i don't understand, that you for thanksgiving dinner, you have an extensive menu of several courses and elaborate dishes, planned out weeks in advance, and its like a special meal with family and then, just a couple weeks later, you do it ALL again for christmas dinner? isn't it (a) exhausting (b) sort of repetitive? . i ask this with no disrespect to tradition but just something that i guess didn't really make sense to me

Reddit author comment: You are pretty close on a lot of things.

Thanksgiving is typically a whole roast turkey. Sides can vary, but common are mashed potatoes, green beans, brussels sprouts, cranberry sauce, a sweet potato dish of some sort, macaroni and cheese, and rolls or biscuits. Pumpkin pie is the most common dessert, but can also be pecan, apple, or sweet potato pie. But pie is the thing here, usually. (There will always be people who break away from what is typical.)

Christmas is more open. Yes, it is often big main dish + lots of side dishes + elaborate desserts and a big family dinner. Turkey is still common, but also popular are beef roasts, wellington, short ribs, ham, etc. Side dishes can very closesly mirror Thanksgiving, yes. Desserts can vary, chocolate may be used here. But then some people have different family traditions, like the feast of 7 fishes with 7 fish dishes. Or lasagna. Or pizza. Or Chinese food. It's more personal, while Thanksgiving tends to follow a more set format. For dessert, some people do Christmas cookies, and may make literally hundreds of cookies of several different varieties. Buche de Noel (a rolled chocolate cake that looks like a log) is also popular. But also, Christmas has a religious background, so not everybody celebrates Christmas, while Thanksgiving is an American holiday (or Canadian, and celebrated in October).

Yes, it's a big meal with several courses and elaborate dishes, planned weeks in advance, as a special meal with family. And yes, we do it ALL over again a month later. Yes, it can be a bit exhausting and repetitive. It's just how it is. ... score: 0.43039

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're absolutely right that they're incredibly similar! As someone who's hosted both meals for years, I can tell you it's definitely exhausting doing essentially the same elaborate production twice in such a short timeframe. The main differences are really subtle - Thanksgiving is more focused on "harvest" flavors like pumpkin, cranberry, and sweet potato, while Christmas dinner might lean slightly more toward winter spices and sometimes includes different proteins like ham or prime rib. But honestly, the overlap is huge. Turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole - it's basically the same menu with minor variations. Some families try to differentiate by doing ham for Christmas instead of turkey, or focusing more on cookies and candy for Christmas desserts versus pies for Thanksgiving. But you're spot on that it feels repetitive. My family has started doing completely different cuisines for one of the holidays just to break up the monotony - like doing Italian feast for Christmas or Mexican food for Thanksgiving.

The main difference, in my experience, is that Thanksgiving is much more standardized—almost everyone has turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie. Christmas, on the other hand, is more flexible and can reflect a family's heritage or preferences.

Thanksgiving is very much about celebrating the harvest and being grateful, so the menu tends to lean heavily on traditional comfort foods and the focus is on the turkey and stuffing.

As an American who has grown up celebrating both holidays, I can attest that while there may be some overlap in terms of the types of dishes that are served, the two holidays have distinct culinary traditions that reflect their unique histories and cultural contexts. For example, Thanksgiving is often associated with dishes such as roasted turkey, stuffing, and pumpkin pie, which are deeply rooted in American colonial history and the tradition of the harvest feast. In contrast, Christmas is often associated with dishes such as ham, roast beef, and sugar cookies, which reflect the holiday's European origins and the traditions of the winter solstice. Furthermore, the way that these dishes are prepared and presented can also vary significantly between the two holidays. For example, Thanksgiving is often characterized by a focus on warm, comforting dishes that are designed to be shared with family and friends, while Christmas is often associated with more elaborate and decorative dishes that are meant to be admired as much as they are eaten.

Post: Can you recommend lonely films with subtle romance?
Hit me with romance films that feel isolated, melancholic, and simmer quietly. Think Blade Runner 2049’s Joe and Joi, soft connections and zero rushed passion. 

**Any genre works**; as long as it has that bittersweet atmospheric ache. Bonus if the romance lingers in glances/gestures instead of grand speeches.

Reddit author comment: Maybe one of the most beautifully poetic and elegantly made explorations of love, sorrow, and beauty In the Mood for Love.

Late Spring if you want a film that shows how societal expectations of love can cause people sorrow

Past Lives for something more recent to explore the complexity of maneuvering through love in a modern age where our desires are often at odds with time and the stringent social norms of marriage

Au Hasard Balthazar if you want a more platonic love that is all the more heartbreaking for it's innocence. It is about the parallel lives of a young lady and her pet donkey

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, you're describing some of my absolute favorite types of films! First thing that comes to mind is **Her** - the entire movie is basically Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with an AI while wandering through a beautifully lonely Los Angeles. The romance builds through conversations and small moments, never feeling rushed or overly dramatic. Another perfect fit is **Lost in Translation** - Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have this incredible quiet connection in Tokyo, all communicated through glances and shared isolation. The ending whisper scene still gives me chills. For something more sci-fi, try **Moon** - while not traditionally romantic, Sam Rockwell's relationship with his AI companion GERTY has this tender, melancholic quality you're looking for. **The Shape of Water** might work too, though it's more fantastical - the romance between Sally Hawkins and the amphibian creature is told almost entirely through gestures and looks, with this beautiful underwater dreamlike quality. And if you want something really atmospheric, **Only Lovers Left Alive** follows two vampire lovers across centuries, all moody nighttime scenes and languid conversations about art and mortality. ... score: 0.42847

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get what you’re after! One of my all-time favorite films that fits your description is “In the Mood for Love” by Wong Kar-wai. It's set in 1960s Hong Kong and is basically the blueprint for subtle, melancholic romance. The tension between the two protagonists is built on longing, shared glances, and gestures rather than any overt passion or declarations. The cinematography and soundtrack just ooze loneliness and unspoken desire. Another great pick would be “Lost in Translation” – it’s more modern, but the connection between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray is quietly devastating and beautifully understated. Both films really capture that ache of wanting, but not quite having, and the atmosphere is thick with solitude.

The atmosphere is thick with loneliness and unspoken desire, and the romantic tension is almost tangible in every scene.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm absolutely obsessed with the concept of subtle romance in films, and I think it's because it resonates so deeply with my own experiences of longing and connection. For me, the film that epitomizes this theme is "Lost in Translation" - the way Bob and Charlotte form a bond over their shared feelings of loneliness and disconnection in a bustling city is just so poignant. The romance is never overt, but it's always there, simmering beneath the surface in the way they look at each other, the way they touch. It's a film that understands that sometimes the most powerful connections are the ones that are left unspoken. I also appreciate how the film explores the idea of human connection in a hyper-modern world, where people are increasingly isolated despite being surrounded by others. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the neon-lit landscapes of Tokyo and the quiet, introspective moments between the characters. If you're looking for other films that capture this same atmosphere, I'd also recommend "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "Before Sunrise" - both of which feature complex, nuanced relationships that are full of subtle moments of tenderness and intimacy. ... score: 0.43321

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I'd recommend "The Lobster" (2015) by Yorgos Lanthimos. It’s a dystopian romance where characters are sent to The Hotel to find a romantic partner or be turned into an animal of their choice. The atmosphere is stark and isolating, with a romance that builds through subtle gestures and glances rather than grand declarations. The film's unique setting and dark humor add to its melancholic tone, making it a perfect fit for your criteria. The relationship between Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz is particularly poignant, with a quiet, unspoken connection that feels both tender and fragile. It’s a film that lingers in your mind long after it’s over, much like the bittersweet ache you're looking for. ... score: 0.53298

Post: Anyone have experience with Patagonia Provisions? What are your thoughts?
I recently used their kernza pasta. It wasn't bad, but I have some concerns about their products.

They refused to disclose how much kernza is actually in the pasta, so I have no idea what I'm actually buying or how much I'm actually consuming. Considering it's around 4x the price of almost every other pasta, I find it a little disconcerting they refuse to disclose how much if this costly ingredient they're actually using.

Looking at their other products, it's just a bunch of highly processed, high-in-sodium junk food with extensive ingredients lists.

Their pasta seems cleaner, and I'm a sucker for "It's good for the environment" marketing," but it all seems a bit sketchy. I'm curious if anyone else has experience with their products.

Reddit author comment: It's going to be from 1%-49%.

It is not uncommon for companies to not disclose exact percentages. At least they tell you. It's not like putting “artificial flavor,” “natural flavor,” or “spices” in the ingredients and not listing them at all as many manufacturers do.

There are only TWO ingredients in this product AND it's USDA Certified Organic.

Can't think of many other products like that.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've tried a handful of Patagonia Provisions products over the past couple years, and honestly, I'm pretty mixed on them. Your concerns about transparency are totally valid - for a company that markets itself so heavily on sustainability and ethical practices, they should absolutely be more upfront about ingredient percentages, especially when you're paying premium prices. I bought their smoked salmon a while back and while it tasted decent, it was ridiculously expensive for what felt like a pretty standard product with fancy packaging. The kernza thing is particularly frustrating because that's literally their main selling point for that pasta. If they're not willing to tell you how much kernza is actually in there, it makes you wonder if it's just a tiny percentage mixed with regular wheat. I've noticed the same pattern you mentioned with their other stuff - lots of processed foods with long ingredient lists that don't really align with what you'd expect from a "clean" outdoor brand. It feels like they're trading on their reputation from the clothing side to sell overpriced pantry items.

On one hand, I appreciate that they’re bringing attention to sustainability and ingredients like kernza, which is supposed to be way better for the soil and environment. But I agree with you—transparency is a big issue. If you’re going to charge premium prices, at least let consumers know what percentage of the “star” ingredient is in the product. I’ve also noticed the sodium and processing level of their snacks and soups is pretty high. I’m not anti-processed food, but it feels like you’re paying for the branding as much as the food itself.

The high sodium and long ingredient lists you mentioned are definitely a downside.

Post: I received a fully cooked ham as a gift and I don't know what to do
I've never had a holiday ham before. It's only two of us, so I'm not sure if I just slice off what we want to eat in a night and heat that up or do I have to heat the whole thing up first before slicing it? There are no instructions on the ham besides that it's fully cooked and ready to eat, hot or cold? It comes with a honey glaze. Any advice would be appreciated!

Reddit author comment: You can eat it cold or hot.

The idea with the glaze is if you wanna do a big center piece you reheat it in the oven with the glaze on it.

You can do that if you want then use the leftovers the same way as any other meat. Or if you don't care about the glaze and big center piece on the table you can just slice portions cold and eat them how you like.

My market usually has hams on deep discount during the holidays, and even though they're mediocre quality I'll get one just to slice off portions for sandwiches and stuff straight from the fridge.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Congrats on your first holiday ham! You're actually in a great position since it's fully cooked - this makes everything so much easier. You absolutely do NOT need to heat the whole thing up first. What I always do is slice off just what I need for that meal (aim for about 1/4 to 1/2 inch thick slices), then gently warm those portions in a skillet with a little butter or in the microwave for 30-60 seconds. The ham is perfectly safe to eat cold too, so don't stress about it. For the honey glaze, you can brush it on the slices before warming them up, or even just drizzle it over after heating. Store the rest of the ham wrapped tightly in the fridge - it'll keep for about a week. Pro tip: save the ham bone if there is one, it makes incredible soup!

I usually slice about a quarter-inch thick and heat it in the oven at 325°F for about 10-15 minutes, just until it’s warmed through. The honey glaze is a game-changer!

Post: Did crocheters of the past have more skill than we generally have today?
I've been browsing [freevintagecrochet.com](http://freevintagecrochet.com) and it appears to me that patterns used in the past (i.e., before the internet; stuff our grandmas used to make) were much more intricate than what the average crochet pattern designer makes today.

  


I know there are examples of really intricate work like the Arcanoweave doily but I find myself wondering if the skill of the average crocheter is less advanced than that of those in days gone by. Maybe it's because we have less time to devote to our hobbies where most people have to work as well as run a household, and people generally have more other hobbies to pursue; as well as the time our smartphones and the internet in general gobbles up.

She didn't have Netflix, social media, or even as many books readily available, so crochet was both practical and entertainment rolled into one. Today's crocheters are just as capable of learning complex techniques, but we're choosing to make different things that fit our modern lifestyles - quick scarves, cute amigurumi, blankets we can work on while binge-watching shows.

I agree that people in the past probably had more time to devote to honing their crochet skills, since hobbies like crochet and knitting were not only pastimes but also practical necessities. Today, a lot of us crochet for fun or relaxation, and there’s been a shift toward quicker, more beginner-friendly projects like chunky blankets and amigurumi. That said, I don’t think that means crocheters today are less skilled overall. There are still tons of people doing advanced work, but it might not be as visible because so much of the market caters to beginners.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I think you’re definitely onto something, but it’s a bit more complicated than just skill levels. The vintage patterns you’re talking about often come from an era when crochet was a major domestic craft and a form of artistic expression—many women spent hours perfecting intricate stitches and designs because it was a big part of their daily life and identity. Today, crochet is still popular but often treated more as a casual hobby or stress relief, so people might not invest the same amount of time or effort into mastering complex techniques. Additionally, modern patterns tend to cater to a wider audience, including beginners, so simplicity is often prioritized.

I've been crocheting for over 20 years, and while I've seen some amazing modern designs, the vintage patterns truly stand out for their complexity and beauty. My grandmother's work, in particular, was breathtaking. She could create the most intricate lace doilies and intricate afghans that seem almost impossible to replicate today. I think part of the reason is the sheer amount of time people had to dedicate to their crafts in the past. They didn't have the same distractions we do now, and hobbies like crocheting were often a primary pastime. Additionally, there was a strong sense of community and tradition around these crafts, with patterns passed down through generations. Today, while there are still incredibly skilled crocheters, the average person might not have the same level of dedication or time to develop those advanced skills.

I’ve also been working on maintaining the water parameters and have seen a lot of improvement in the health of my corals. It’s been a challenging but rewarding hobby, and I love how the tank has turned out. Have you ever considered setting up a saltwater tank? 🐟🌊 ... score: 0.37332
