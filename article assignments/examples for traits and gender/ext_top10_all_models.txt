Post: What’s a good 1.5 Weeks New England itinerary for the summer?
As the title states, I am looking for some itinerary/ ideas for visiting New England for a week and a half in the summer. 

I’m looking to site see, go on hikes/ enjoy outdoors, and eat good food. 

I know I won’t be able to see all 6 states but I would like to see Massachusetts, Rhode Island, andd I’m not sure what else I should try to fit -  open to many ideas :) 

Reddit author comment: Here’s what we did a few years ago and enjoyed it- it was a bit rushed so hopefully with your week and a half yours might not need to be so rushed.

Day 1-2 Portland, ME. Highlights were stopping in Kennebunkport for lunch, Cape Elizabeth, sunset lighthouse boat tour, Coastal Maine Botanical Gardens, LL Bean store, Fore Street restaurant.

Day 3-5 Boston, MA. Did most of the standard tourist things- Freedom trail, Red Sox game, Harvard tour, etc.

Days 5-7 Cape Cod, MA (Falmouth). We loved the shining sea bike trail and checking out the beaches, wineries, and restaurants in the area. 

Would highly recommend including Maine on your trip if you can- it was our favorite! I wish we had been able to go to Bar Harbor & Acadia National Park but it wasn’t in the cards for us that trip! ... score: 0.6885

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: **u/NewEnglandNomad**: Oh man, you're in for a treat! For 1.5 weeks, I'd definitely suggest starting in Boston for 2-3 days to hit the Freedom Trail, North End for amazing Italian food, and maybe catch a Red Sox game at Fenway. From there, head up to New Hampshire's White Mountains - the hiking there is absolutely incredible, especially Mount Washington if you're up for a challenge, or the easier Diana's Baths waterfall hike. Spend 2-3 days there, then work your way down through Vermont (Burlington is charming and has great breweries) and into the Berkshires in western Mass for some beautiful mountain scenery. End with Rhode Island - Newport's mansions are gorgeous and the Cliff Walk is perfect for photos. Don't miss the clam chowder in Boston, lobster rolls literally anywhere in Maine if you venture that far north, and Vermont cheddar cheese. The summer weather will be perfect for all the outdoor activities you're planning! ... score: 0.6452

I’d suggest starting in Boston—spend at least 2–3 days there to soak in the Freedom Trail, North End (for great Italian food), and maybe take a day trip to Salem or Cambridge. Next, head south to Rhode Island. Newport is a must: tour the Gilded Age mansions, walk the Cliff Walk, and enjoy seafood by the water. After that, consider heading to western Massachusetts—Berkshires for hiking (like Mount Greylock) and artsy towns (Lenox, Stockbridge). If you want more nature, tack on a couple days in Vermont’s Green Mountains or New Hampshire’s White Mountains for gorgeous trails and charming small towns. You’ll get a great mix of city, coast, and mountain experiences! ... score: 0.617

Post: Is it worth reviving old projects?
Years ago, I built a Microsoft Paint clone using plain JavaScript and CSS. It was a fun little project, especially for nostalgia sake. But looking back, the code is a real mess, and it lacks modern features.

Now, I’m thinking of reviving it with better technologies (React, TypeScript...) and making it useful.  
l. Maybe even turning it into a web-based alternative to Paint.NET.

Do you think it’s worth the effort?

PS: here is the project [Link](https://github.com/salahkai/MS-PAINT/) if you're interested.

Reddit author comment: Programmer here. Yes, 100% worth it.

Don't even think about it as a "revival"... it's a re-write and a whole new edition (not just new version).

When I'm learning a new technology/language/framework I nearly always start by making a simple project that I've made before, only now using the new technology. It makes it so much easier to learn a new thing/tool/tech when you are 100% familiar with the project itself.

It also makes it easier to recognize how the new thing is different. You might find that the new technology now automates something you used to do manually every single time. You might not even notice that feature in the new tech, until you're actively building something.

I have at least one personal project that has been made into 7-8 editions over the years. ... score: 0.6572

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely worth it! I went through something similar with an old Node.js project I built in college. The original code was embarrassing - no error handling, inconsistent naming, the works. But reviving it taught me more about software architecture than any tutorial ever could. You get to see firsthand how your skills have evolved, and you already have a working prototype to build from. The fact that you're considering React and TypeScript shows you're thinking about scalability and maintainability, which is exactly what the original probably lacked. Plus, the web-based Paint.NET alternative space isn't that crowded - there's definitely room for a well-executed project. I'd suggest starting small though. Maybe pick one core feature to modernize first (like the brush system or layer management) rather than rewriting everything at once. That way you can validate whether the effort is worth continuing before you're too deep in the weeds. ... score: 0.5852

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely worth it! Reviving old projects can be incredibly rewarding, both for personal growth and for the potential practical value you can offer others. Your old MS Paint clone is a perfect candidate—graphics editors are a classic way to level up your skills in UI/UX, state management, and canvas manipulation. Rebuilding it with React and TypeScript will not only modernize your codebase but also make it more maintainable and potentially easier for others to contribute to. Plus, web-based alternatives to Paint.NET are surprisingly rare; a lightweight, easy-to-use online paint tool could fill a real niche.

Post: I’ve still never seen an imax or 3d movie.
The price of tickets is usually like 25-35% higher, and there's more people generally than the standard "laser" at amc. 
Am I missing a lot? Would you say it's only more important for big action movies, stuff like Jurassic park, dune, avatar, etc? Or is any movie better in imax?

Also, do I need special glasses for imax movies?
Should I see Mickey 17 in imax?


Reddit author comment: If you’re going to AMC, and you’re interested in IMAX films, I’d say it’s worth it to get the AMC A-List. Depending on area, it’s really only like 23, 24 bucks (maybe a couple more). But it lets you see up to 3 movies a week and it includes premium formats like IMAX, 3D, or Dolby for no extra cost.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: You're definitely missing out, but it really depends on the type of movie! IMAX is absolutely worth it for visually spectacular films like the ones you mentioned - Dune, Avatar, big sci-fi epics, Marvel movies, etc. The screen is massive and the sound system is incredible, so you feel completely immersed. However, for smaller dramas, comedies, or dialogue-heavy films, regular screens are perfectly fine and you're not missing much. As for glasses, you don't need special glasses for regular IMAX - only for IMAX 3D showings. Regular IMAX is just a bigger screen with better audio. For Mickey 17, since it's a Bong Joon-ho sci-fi film, I'd say it could be worth the IMAX experience depending on how visually ambitious it is. My advice: try IMAX once with a big blockbuster that was filmed specifically for IMAX cameras (like recent Christopher Nolan films), and you'll immediately understand whether the premium is worth it for you personally. ... score: 0.6371

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Honestly, I think IMAX and 3D are best reserved for movies that are specifically filmed or formatted for those experiences. For example, when I saw "Avatar: The Way of Water" in IMAX 3D, it was absolutely stunning and worth every extra penny—James Cameron really knows how to use the technology. But for most dramas or comedies, I don't think the extra cost or the larger crowd makes much difference. Also, not all IMAX screens are created equal; some are just bigger regular screens, so it depends on your local theater. As for glasses, you only need them for 3D showings, not regular IMAX. If you're excited for "Mickey 17" and it's got a lot of visual spectacle, it might be worth trying IMAX for your first time! ... score: 0.5829

If you’re watching something like Jurassic Park, Dune, or Avatar, the immersive visuals and sound really add to the experience and make it feel more epic. For smaller or dialogue-heavy films, the difference might not be worth the extra cost. Plus, the theaters tend to be more crowded during IMAX/3D showings, which can be a downside if you prefer a quieter environment. And yes, for 3D movies you definitely need those special glasses, but for IMAX, it depends—some IMAX screenings are just giant screens with enhanced sound and don’t require glasses unless it’s also 3D. Mickey 17 might be a good candidate if it has a lot of visual effects or expansive scenes, but double-check if it’s being shown in IMAX or 3D at your local theater before buying tickets. ... score: 0.5524

The ones that really benefit from the format are the ones with a lot of visual effects, like superhero movies or sci-fi epics. However, I think it's also worth noting that some movies are specifically designed to be seen in IMAX, like Christopher Nolan's films, which are often shot using IMAX cameras. These movies are optimized for the IMAX format and really take advantage of the larger screen and higher resolution. As for whether you need special glasses for IMAX movies, the answer is no. IMAX uses a different projection system that doesn't require glasses, unlike 3D movies. So, if you're considering seeing Mickey 17 in IMAX, I'd say go for it if you're a fan of the author or the genre, but if you're on a budget, the standard laser format will still be a great way to experience the movie. ... score: 0.6321

I went frustrated so quick that I've lost my camera few months ago but still unable to bring everything together and start again so 
I'm currently thinking of to start a post production agency as I'm good at editing reels for YouTubers.
I've some very good editors in my team but unable to get more clients.
No I need help to start and should I do it or not?

Reddit author comment: First of all, you really don't sound confident/professional at all (no offense). If you have to ask questions like this without even knowing the current situation of the market you are trying to get in to... your business is going to fail miserably.

Do you even have a clue on how to run a business? Do you know how to be an online marketing guru? Do you realize you will be competing against people from third-world countries spewing out twice as much edits for 1/10th of the price? Do you realize you'll soon be competing against AI? How are you going to run a post-processing agency in this market?

So no, don't start an 'agency'. You won't be able to compete. You might get some pocket money here and there though.

But honestly, pivoting to post-production could be a brilliant move, especially since you already have experience and a team of good editors. The demand for video editing is absolutely exploding right now with everyone trying to create content for social media. Here's my take: if you're genuinely good at editing and have a solid team, you should definitely go for it. The key challenge you mentioned is getting clients, which is probably the biggest hurdle for any service-based business. Have you tried reaching out to local businesses, influencers, or content creators directly? LinkedIn can be gold for B2B outreach.

Post: Can Arnis / Eskrima techniques be applied using forearms?
Would it be viable to adapt arnis/eskrima techniques to strike with the forearms (provided they are conditioned) instead of using a stick or knife? By viable I mean in empty hand combat. If it is viable, what martial arts should I learn along with that to supplement?

Reddit author comment: Why reinvent the wheel? There is going to be a variety of crossover to all martial arts, and depending on your skill level of interest, more or less. As being top elite in a specific competition will tend to reduce some crossover that works for generic training and a avg "foot soldier" level person. 


Just take any unarmed art that has functional reality and it'll all track well enough. You're not going to be a better fighter doing sword/stick strikes with your forearm, than if you know how to punch. 


Either take the associated art unarmed combat as FMA has. Or take like Muay Thai or another kickboxing. 


Or take Judo/BJJ and learn grappling, which translates great to real weapon fights and allows you to use strikes as set up/opener to the grappling. ... score: 0.6414

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Absolutely! This is actually a pretty common adaptation that many FMA practitioners explore. The biomechanics of stick and blade work translate surprisingly well to forearm strikes, especially the angles of attack and flow patterns. Your forearms essentially become your weapons, and the same 12 angles of attack in most Eskrima systems work great with forearm conditioning. However, you'll want to be careful about range - sticks give you extended reach that forearms obviously don't, so you'll need to adjust your distance management. For supplementary arts, I'd highly recommend Muay Thai for the clinch work and elbow techniques, plus some Panantukan (Filipino boxing) if you can find it, since it's specifically designed as the empty-hand component of FMA. Silat also pairs beautifully with this approach since it emphasizes similar flowing movements and limb destruction concepts. Just make sure you're conditioning your forearms properly - start light and build up gradually, or you'll end up with some nasty injuries that'll set back your training. ... score: 0.5285

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, a lot of Arnis/Eskrima techniques can be adapted to use the forearms, especially in empty hand combat scenarios. Many Filipino martial arts (FMA) systems have what’s called “panantukan” or “dirty boxing,” which is essentially the empty hand adaptation of their stick and blade movements. The motions you learn with a stick (angles, deflections, redirections) can be mirrored with your arms, and forearm strikes can be very effective, especially in close quarters. Forearm shots can be used for blocking, parrying, and striking (think hammerfist, ridge hand, or elbow-like motions). To supplement your training, you might want to look into Muay Thai for its clinch work and elbow/forearm strikes, or even boxing for its hand and arm mechanics. Kali/Arnis instructors who focus on the “empty hand” side of things (like Panantukan or Dumog) would be perfect, as they often bridge the gap between weapon and empty hand applications. Just make sure your forearms are conditioned properly to avoid injury! ... score: 0.5177

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Absolutely, adapting Arnis/Eskrima techniques to forearm strikes can be viable in empty-hand combat, especially if your forearms are well-conditioned. Traditional Arnis emphasizes weapon-based movement, angles, and timing, which can translate effectively to forearm strikes, blocks, and parries. The forearm can be used for powerful blocks, checks, and even offensive strikes, mimicking the stick’s linear motions but with added versatility since it’s part of your body. To supplement this, learning arts like Muay Thai for clinch work and conditioning, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for grappling transitions, and perhaps Filipino Martial Arts empty-hand systems like Panantukan (Filipino boxing) could round out your skill set. Panantukan specifically bridges the gap between weapon-based and empty-hand combat, focusing on similar angles, traps, and strikes with hands and forearms. Conditioning is key, so incorporating forearm strengthening exercises and impact conditioning drills would enhance the effectiveness. Overall, blending Eskrima principles with forearm strikes is not only viable but can create a unique and effective empty-hand fighting style. ... score: 0.4746

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the idea of adapting martial arts techniques to empty-hand combat, and using forearms in Arnis/Eskrima is an intriguing concept. The key to successfully applying these techniques would be to condition the forearms to withstand the impact, as well as to develop the proper technique and timing. It's essential to note that the forearms are not as durable as sticks or knives, so the strikes would need to be more precise and controlled. In terms of supplementing with other martial arts, I would recommend learning Judo or Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to improve grappling skills, as well as Muay Thai or Boxing to enhance striking techniques.

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Forearm strikes can definitely be effective, but it's important to understand the biomechanics and risks involved. In Arnis/Eskrima, the stick serves as an extension of the arm, providing leverage and reach. When using your forearms, you lose some of that leverage, so you need to focus on generating power from your core and hips. I'd recommend checking out arts like Krav Maga or Systema, which both emphasize practical, no-nonsense techniques for self-defense. These systems can teach you how to deliver powerful strikes and defend against various attacks. Also, consider incorporating some boxing or kickboxing to improve your overall striking abilities and footwork. ... score: 0.5435

Post: Which chemistry set would you recommend?
I am a non-professional chemist and I am looking for a set of chemicals. About six years ago I got a chemistry kit. I have the equipment, however I don't have many chemicals. Idealy, I would want a kit of chemicals, that aren't in big quantities (such as 1kg) and I can do interesting experiments with them. Can you recommend a chemistry set? 

Thanks in advance!

Reddit author comment: My chemistry set consists of Amazon, aliexpress, ebay, walmart, canadian tire, home depot.... And a credit card.

"Interesting" really depends on what you want to do. To me, what's more important than the physical chemicals is the knowledge of how to get a reaction out of them. I pick a reaction i want to do, say make sodium metal, and then i go find the chemicals for it. In my case drain cleaner, magnesium firestarters, baby oil, menthol crystals, and energizer batteries. Then with some time and effort, i turn that into sodium metal... which i then throw into a bucket of water and make them explode.

If you're looking around for chemistry sets, see if you can download and review the manual first. That's the real gem of the set. See if the experiments are interesting and the kinds you want to do.

Alternatively, don't even get the set, see if you can source the individual chemicals domestically, thats a whole adventure in itself. 

Granted, my way might be a little expensive, i think i've blown maybe $80k on my hobby so far. ... score: 0.6374

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from - having the glassware but needing to restock on chemicals is a common situation. I'd highly recommend checking out **The Science Company** or **United Nuclear** for smaller quantities of reagents. They sell chemicals in much more reasonable amounts (like 25g-100g bottles) which is perfect for home experimentation. For interesting experiments, I'd suggest getting basics like copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium carbonate, citric acid, and some indicator solutions. You could also look into **Carolina Biological Supply** - they have educational chemical sets that come with smaller quantities specifically designed for demonstrations and experiments. Another great option is **Flinn Scientific**, though they primarily sell to educators, you might be able to purchase through them if you explain your educational interest. Just remember to always follow proper safety protocols, have good ventilation, and check your local regulations about chemical storage and disposal.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you're coming from! It's surprisingly tricky to find kits that provide just the chemicals without all the basic equipment. Most modern "chemistry sets" marketed for adults seem to focus on safety and simple experiments, so they often only include small quantities of fairly mundane chemicals. If you're looking for a wider variety, I’d recommend checking out Home Science Tools—they sell a bunch of individual chemicals in small bottles (like 30g or 100g), and you can build your own set based on what interests you. Just be aware of the legal restrictions in your area; some compounds are regulated or require you to state your intended use. Another option is Thames & Kosmos’ "Chem C3000," which is one of the most advanced kits you can buy, though it’s still limited compared to what you remember from older chemistry sets.

Post: Light rail, SeaTac to downtown, is this feasible?
Will be visiting Seattle for a concert at Climate Pledge Arena.  I'm trying to avoid a rental car and parking.  I would like to take the light rail from the airport to downtown, stay in a hotel within walking distance of the arena, and get back to the airport by light rail.  Is this plan feasible?  I've mapped it and it looks easy enough.  Just looking for actual experience if I am setting myself up for a nightmare.  I've been to Seattle a few times, but never used the public transportation system.  Thanks!

Reddit author comment: Great answers for everyone, but I'll add a bit of context that may make things less confusing. Our light rail is called the Link. The downtown station is called Westlake. However, there are two different types of trains that come out of Westlake. The first is the Link which is underground at that point. The second is the monorail, which is on an elevated track. So if you want to take the train from Westlake to Seattle Center (the area where the stadium is), do not get on the Link. That will take you to Capitol Hill which is even further away from the arena. Get on the monorail. That will take you really close to the stadium. If you don't want to take the monorail there, it's a 1.5 mile walk. Just walk up second. ... score: 0.6278

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is absolutely feasible and honestly one of the best ways to get around Seattle for what you're planning! I've done this exact trip multiple times. The light rail (Link Light Rail) runs directly from SeaTac to downtown Seattle, and it's super convenient. The journey takes about 45-50 minutes from the airport to downtown stations like Westlake Center or University Street. Climate Pledge Arena is in Seattle Center, which is a bit north of the main downtown core, but totally walkable from hotels in Belltown or Lower Queen Anne - probably a 10-15 minute walk max. If you stay somewhere near the Westlake Center area, you might want to take the Seattle Center Monorail (it's like $3.50) which goes directly from downtown to Seattle Center, or just walk about 20 minutes. The light rail runs frequently (every 8-15 minutes depending on time of day) and is clean and reliable. Just make sure to check the schedule for your return trip to the airport, especially if your concert ends late - the last trains run around midnight on weekdays and 2 AM on weekends. You'll save money on parking (which can be $30+ near the arena) and avoid traffic headaches. Definitely recommend this plan! ... score: 0.6947

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As someone who has lived in Seattle for over a decade, I've had the pleasure of watching the light rail system grow and expand, and I must say, it's been a game-changer for getting around the city without a car. The route from SeaTac to downtown is incredibly convenient, and I've taken it countless times to get to sporting events, concerts, and even just to explore the city. The trip takes around 40 minutes, which is relatively quick, and the trains run frequently, so you won't have to wait long for the next one. One thing to keep in mind is that the light rail can get crowded during peak hours, especially when there are events at the arena, so it's a good idea to plan your trip accordingly.

Post: Will expansion to 48 teams actually cause the World Cup to have 16 teams worse than Saudi Arabia?
**TL;DR**: No. Only 4-9 teams worse than Saudi Arabia would qualify


I wanted to post this on r/soccer, but they don't allow text posts, so I'm posting this here.



Since Saudi Arabia lost 5-0 to Russia, I have seen several claims that once the World Cup is expanded to 48 teams, it will include 16 teams worse than Saudia Arabia. I decided to test how many teams worse than Saudi Arabia would have qualified for this World Cup if it were a 48 team tournament. I defined a team worse than Saudi Arabia as one ranking lower on [FIFA’s ranking system](https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/index.html) than Saudi Arabia (currently 67), and looked at both the qualification results, and the current FIFA world rankings (June 7, 2018) to see which teams would qualify. Throughout this post, FIFA rankings are included in parentheses next to a country’s name


AFC

Current - 4.5 Spots

Qualified - Iran (37), Japan (61), South Korea (57), Saudi Arabia (67), Australia (36, won intercontinental playoff against Honduras)

These are the top 5 AFC teams by FIFA’s ranking system.

Under the expansion, AFC gets 8 teams, which would add Syria (73), China (75) and UAE (77) based on the rating system. Based on the actual qualification results, taking the top 4 teams from each of the final groups would put Uzbekistan (95) in the World Cup instead of China. Ultimately, this would add 3 teams that are worse than Saudi Arabia.


CAF

Current - 5 Spots

Qualified - Tunisia (21), Nigeria (48), Morocco (41), Senegal (27), Egypt (45)

Top 5 by FIFA’s ranking system: Tunisia, Senegal, DR Congo (38), Morocco, Egypt

Under the expansion, AFC gets 9 teams, which would add DR Congo, Ghana (47), Cameroon (49), and Burkina Faso (52) based on the rating system. The actual qualification ended with 5 groups of 4 teams. Taking the best 4 runners-up would add DR Congo, Burkina Faso, Uganda (82), and either Ivory Coast (68). Ultimately, this adds at most 2 teams worse than Saudi Arabia.


CONCACAF

Current - 3.5 Spots

Qualified - Mexico (15), Costa Rica (23), Panama (55). (Honduras lost intercontinental playoff against Australia)

Top 4 by FIFA’s ranking system: Mexico, Costa Rica, USA (25), Jamaica (54)

Under the expansion, CONCACAF gets 6 teams, which would add USA, Jamaica, and Honduras (62), based on the rating system. The actual qualification ended with a group of six, featuring Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, USA, and Trinidad and Tobago (91). Ultimately, this adds at most 1 team worse than Saudi Arabia.


CONMEBOL

Current - 4.5 Spots

Qualified - Brazil (2), Uruguay (14), Argentina (5), Colombia (16), Peru (11) (Won intercontinental playoff against New Zealand)

Top 5 by FIFA’s ranking system: Brazil, Argentina, Chile (11), Peru, Uruguay

Under the expansion, CONMEBOL gets 6 spots, which would give Chile a spot based on both ranking and on qualification results. This adds no teams worse than Saudi Arabia.


OFC

Current - 0.5 Spots

Qualified - None. (New Zealand lost intercontinental playoff against Peru)

Top team by FIFA’s ranking system: New Zealand (120)

Under the expansion, OFC gets one spot, which would give New Zealand a spot based on both ranking and on qualification results. This adds 1 team worse than Saudi Arabia.


UEFA

Current - 13 Spots (Plus Host)

Qualified - Russia (Host, 70), France (7), Portugal (4), Germany (1), Serbia (34), Poland (8), England (12), Spain (10), Belgium (3), Iceland (22), Switzerland (6), Croatia (20), Denmark (12), Sweden (24)

Top 13 teams by FIFA’s ranking system: Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, England, Netherlands (17), Wales (18), Italy (19), Croatia

Under the expansion, UEFA gets 16 spots, one of which would go to the host (Russia). Based on FIFA’s ranking system, the top 15 teams are Germany, Belgium, Portugal, Switzerland, France, Poland, Spain, Denmark, England, Netherlands, Wales, Italy, Croatia, Iceland (22), and Sweden (24). Notably, this excludes the actually qualified team Serbia.

Based on actual qualification results, the teams would be the actually qualified teams as well as two of the losers of the second round matches: Northern Ireland (29), Greece (44), Republic of Ireland (31), and Italy.

This adds no teams worse than Saudi Arabia, except for Russia. However, based on the match between Russia and Saudi Arabia, Russia is clearly better.


Playoff: The expansion allocates the last two spots to the winners of a playoff between 6 teams. Each confederation except UEFA provides one of these teams, and the host confederation gets the last spot. In this case, since UEFA is hosting, they would get the spot.

AFC: Based on ranking, Lebanon (79). Based on qualification results, China (75). Either way, the team is worse than Saudi Arabia.

CAF: Based on ranking, Mali (64). Based on qualification results, Zambia (76). This adds at most one team based on Saudi Arabia.

CONCACAF: Based on ranking, El Salvador (72). Based on qualification results, Guatemala (146). Either way, the team is worse than Saudi Arabia.

CONMEBOL: Based on ranking or qualification results, Paraguay (32). This team is not worse than Saudi Arabia.

OFC: Based on ranking or qualification results, Solomon Islands (143). This team is worse than Saudi Arabia.

UEFA: One of the remaining losers of the second round matches. Whichever is chosen, the team is not worse than Saudi Arabia.

The playoff contains 3-4 teams worse than Saudi Arabia, and at least 2 much better teams. Likely, the playoff is won by those teams.


Overall, the tournament adds 4-9 teams worse than Saudi Arabia, based on FIFA’s ranking system. This is a far cry from the 16 teams that some have claimed would be added. However, these results should be taken with a grain of salt, as they are based largely on FIFA’s ranking system, which has Russia as a worse team than Saudi Arabia. However, I do think it is fair to say that expanding the tournament will not add 16 teams worse than Saudi Arabia.

Edit: I have since reposted an improved version of this on r/soccer [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/8rodjj/will_expansion_to_48_teams_actually_cause_the/)

Reddit author comment: Firstly, you cannot rely on World rankings as a measure of quality. They are inherently flawed, with team like Poland able to game the system. They only play against very poor teams in friendlies, which means they rarely lose and are rewarded with a high ranking place.

Secondly, Russia are ranked lower than Saudi as they have not played any competitive football. As the host qualifies automatically, they are unable to attribute any competitive ranking points.

If you want to see the best teams in the world, you would award more places to Europe. But, the question is whether the World Cup should be about representing the whole world or having the best teams. ... score: 0.6266

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is actually a really well-researched post that challenges a lot of the lazy assumptions people make about World Cup expansion. I've seen so many comments on r/soccer and other football forums where people just assume that going to 48 teams means we're going to get a bunch of absolute minnows who will get destroyed 10-0 every match. Your analysis shows that's just not the case - we're talking about maybe 4-9 teams that rank lower than Saudi Arabia, not 16. And honestly, using Saudi Arabia as the benchmark is pretty arbitrary anyway since they had a decent qualifying campaign and just had a nightmare against Russia (who clearly aren't as bad as their FIFA ranking suggests). The reality is that teams like Italy, Netherlands, Chile, and USA would have made it under the expanded format, and those are all quality sides that probably deserved to be there more than some teams that did qualify. I think people forget that the current 32-team format already includes some pretty weak teams, and the gap between the 32nd best team and the 40th best team in the world really isn't that massive. The expanded format might actually make the tournament more interesting in the group stages. ... score: 0.5814

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Great analysis! I think a lot of people are just reacting emotionally to the idea of expansion rather than looking at the numbers. Sure, there will always be a few teams that seem out of their depth, but the claim that “16 teams worse than Saudi Arabia” will qualify is just lazy exaggeration. As you pointed out, most of the “new” teams would still be from regions with decent footballing pedigree, and some like DR Congo, Ghana, or Chile are hardly “bad” teams. And regarding the FIFA rankings, while they’re not perfect, they’re at least a consistent benchmark. Plus, football is unpredictable—Saudi Arabia beat Argentina in 2022!

The FIFA ranking system isn’t perfect, but it’s a decent indicator here, and your breakdown by confederation is super helpful. The fact that we’re looking at maybe 4 to 9 teams worse than Saudi Arabia instead of 16 completely changes the narrative. Plus, expanding gives more nations a chance to experience the World Cup atmosphere and develop their football culture, which is important for the global growth of the game.

It's interesting to see how the actual qualification results compare to the rankings. I'm still a bit skeptical about the quality of some of the teams that might get in, but it's definitely not as dire as some people are making it out to be. I think the real benefit of the expansion is that it will give more countries a chance to participate in the World Cup, which is a huge deal for football development in those regions. It's also exciting for fans of those teams who might not otherwise get to see their country represented on the biggest stage. Overall, I think it's a positive move, even if it means a few more lower-ranked teams in the tournament. ... score: 0.6519

Post: What are the current technological limitations on terraforming?
For example, with desertification happening in a ton of places around the world, what, outside of monetary cost, is limiting changing climates on a reasonable scale?

Reddit author comment: Other than money? Time, resources, manpower and tech, mostly. The scale of the planet is immense. Even changing a tiny part of it takes years. For example, the Suez canal is only 600ft wide and 120 miles long, but it took 10 years to complete, even with heavy machinery helping for most of it. Granted, it was built quite a while ago. With today's tech, they could probably get it done a lot faster, but it would still take at least a year or two. 

Terrforming in any scope is a huge undertaking. Terraforming to change climates on a large scale is astronomic. Not to say we shouldn't try. Desertification is going to become a huge problem in the coming years. We're just going to have to be strategic about it so our efforts can be maximized in the shortest amount of time possible.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: The biggest limitation is honestly the sheer scale and complexity of climate systems. When we talk about terraforming or even just reversing desertification, we're dealing with interconnected systems that we still don't fully understand. Take atmospheric composition - even small changes can have massive cascading effects. We can plant trees and install solar panels, but creating sustainable water cycles, maintaining soil chemistry, and establishing stable ecosystems requires technology we're still developing. The energy requirements alone are staggering. Plus, many of our current geoengineering proposals are theoretical at best. We can model climate change, but actively controlling it on a planetary scale? That's like trying to steer a hurricane with a fan. The feedback loops and unintended consequences could be catastrophic. ... score: 0.5508

gpt4.1-instruct comment: One of the biggest technological limitations to large-scale terraforming or reversing desertification is our relatively limited ability to manipulate regional or global climates in a controlled way. We can plant trees, irrigate, and use certain soil amendments to rehabilitate small areas, but scaling that up to entire regions is a different challenge. The atmosphere and climate systems are incredibly complex, and any intervention could have unintended consequences. For example, cloud seeding has been tried in some places, but the results are unpredictable and sometimes negligible. We also lack materials and machinery robust enough to handle harsh environments at scale—think of the logistics of irrigating the entire Sahara. So, aside from money, the main issues are the limits of our understanding of climate science, the unpredictability of large-scale interventions, and the lack of robust, scalable technology. ... score: 0.5565

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: One major technological limitation when it comes to terraforming or large-scale climate modification is the sheer complexity of Earth's ecosystems. Even small changes in temperature, humidity, or soil chemistry can have unpredictable ripple effects on local flora and fauna. While we have some tools for localized interventions—like irrigation projects or reforestation efforts—scaling those up to effectively reverse desertification or alter climate patterns is a different beast altogether. We’re also limited by our ability to accurately model and predict how these interventions will interact with natural systems over time. Without precise control, attempts at large-scale climate engineering could backfire or cause unintended ecological damage. ... score: 0.5226

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a space enthusiast, I've always been fascinated by the concept of terraforming, and I believe that understanding the current technological limitations is crucial for making progress in this field. One of the primary limitations is our current understanding of the complex interactions between the atmosphere, geology, and life on Earth. We still have much to learn about how these systems interact and respond to changes, which makes it challenging to predict the outcomes of large-scale terraforming efforts. Moreover, even if we had a thorough understanding of these interactions, we would need significant technological advancements in areas such as climate engineering, geoengineering, and biotechnology to make meaningful changes to a planet's environment. For instance, we would need to develop more efficient and scalable methods for capturing and utilizing CO2, as well as technologies that can simulate the effects of a stable and self-sustaining ecosystem. Another significant limitation is the sheer scale of terraforming efforts, which would require massive amounts of resources, including energy, materials, and labor. However, I believe that by continuing to advance our understanding of the underlying science and developing new technologies, we can overcome these limitations and make terraforming a reality in the future. ... score: 0.5536

The government at the moment is very hot on stable coins, yet we now have the company telcoin that can now legally issue dollar backed stablecoins. They are planning for the US dollar, Mexican peso, Philippine peso, etc. the biggest remittance corridors there are, and yet we don’t spread the news? I mean, this is tech! Actual adoption and use of crypto. I just don’t get how they don’t have the CT backing or support from more people. It’s an older company that survived bear markets and is still building and it’s at its peak potential right now. And I haven even talked about telecoms, the telcoin network, and how the token is used in the systems they are soon releasing.

Reddit author comment: Think I bought this in 2017 and forgot about them. Are they worth anything?

I know they were trying to market to mobile phone carriers because in many places in the world, there is no internet but there is a  mobile phone antenna and their coin would be sendable through phone carriers via codes that owners could punch in.

The thing seemed like a good idea but then Elon musk launched thousands of satellites into space and now even the most remote corners of the world have access to internet so they can use any other coin. The business model seems obsolete. I was in the Serengeti last year and could stream 4k content to my ipad using starlink in my tent at night. ... score: 0.6226

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been following Telcoin for a while now and you're absolutely right about the lack of mainstream attention. The Nebraska banking charter approval is HUGE - like historically significant for crypto adoption in the US. What really gets me is that everyone's always complaining about crypto not having "real world utility" and here's Telcoin literally building infrastructure to connect traditional banking with crypto services. The remittance market they're targeting is massive, especially for underbanked populations who get crushed by traditional money transfer fees. The fact that they can legally issue stablecoins while regulators are cracking down everywhere else shows they've done their homework on compliance. I think the problem is that Telcoin doesn't have the flashy marketing or celebrity endorsements that pump other coins. They're just quietly building actual infrastructure while everyone else chases meme coins. The telecom partnerships and Fed rail access could be game-changing for financial inclusion. Sometimes the most revolutionary projects fly under the radar until they suddenly don't. This feels like one of those "when you know, you know" situations. ... score: 0.478

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you’re coming from – Telcoin is one of those projects that has been grinding for years, staying relatively under the radar while quietly making huge regulatory moves. Most crypto hype is focused on flashy DeFi protocols, meme coins, or whatever is pumping, but Telcoin’s approach is more foundational. The Nebraska bank charter is huge: direct access to Fed rails for a crypto-native entity is almost unheard of. The fact that they’re targeting remittances with legal, compliant stablecoins for corridors like the US-Mexico and US-Philippines is a massively underserved area. It could have a real-world impact for millions, not just speculators. I think part of the reason for the lack of coverage is that Telcoin doesn’t market aggressively and isn’t VC-backed like other shiny projects. Also, their tech is a bit behind-the-scenes – unless you’re really following the regulatory crypto space, it’s easy to miss. But if they execute, I agree, this could be one of the biggest real use cases for crypto to date. The community really needs to look past the price and hype cycles sometimes and pay attention to projects with actual utility. ... score: 0.6074

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Honestly, I’ve been following Telcoin for a while, and I agree it’s super underrated given everything they’re accomplishing. Getting conditional approval for a US Digital Asset Bank charter is HUGE, especially since it means direct access to Fed rails, which no other crypto company has managed so far. This isn’t just hype or speculation; it’s real infrastructure that could revolutionize how remittances are handled globally. The focus on dollar-backed stablecoins for major remittance corridors like the US, Mexico, and the Philippines is exactly what crypto needs — practical use cases that improve everyday financial transactions. It’s baffling that mainstream crypto media barely covers this because it challenges the narrative that crypto is only speculative. Telcoin survived bear markets, regulatory hurdles, and still keeps building solid tech and partnerships. The telecom integration and the token usage in their ecosystem could also drive real token demand, which is rare. If more people paid attention, we might see more adoption and support, but for now, it feels like a hidden gem in the crypto space. Definitely worth watching closely. ... score: 0.5646

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think the lack of attention Telcoin is receiving is largely due to the fact that it's not as flashy or trendy as some of the other cryptocurrencies out there, and it doesn't have a huge marketing budget to blow on superficial promotional campaigns, but what it does have is substance, and that's what truly matters in the long run, the company's ability to navigate the complex regulatory landscape and secure approval for a US Digital Asset Bank charter is a testament to its dedication and expertise, and I believe that as more people begin to understand the significance of this achievement, Telcoin will start to receive the recognition it deserves, it's not just about being the most popular or widely-known cryptocurrency, it's about being a pioneer in the industry and making a real impact, and Telcoin is certainly doing that. ... score: 0.4848

mixtral-8x22B-instruct-v0.1 comment: Comment 1: I couldn't agree more! Telcoin's achievements are truly impressive and it's a shame they don't get the recognition they deserve. Their work in Nebraska and now with the US Digital Asset Bank charter could revolutionize the way we think about and use cryptocurrency. Plus, their focus on stablecoins and remittance corridors is a game-changer. I'm excited to see what they do next! #Telcoin #Crypto #Adoption ... score: 0.6398

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: Absolutely, I couldn't agree more! Telcoin has been doing some groundbreaking work, and it's a shame they don't get the recognition they deserve. The fact that they've been instrumental in pushing pro-crypto legislation and are now on the verge of launching a digital asset bank is huge. This isn't just about crypto for the sake of crypto; it's about real, tangible use cases that can change the financial landscape. Their ability to issue stablecoins for major remittance corridors is a game-changer, especially for those who rely on cross-border transactions. It's frustrating to see so much focus on flashy new projects while solid, established companies like Telcoin are overlooked. We need more people to recognize and support the companies that are actually making a difference. It's time for the crypto community to step up and give Telcoin the attention and backing they deserve. Let's start spreading the word and making sure this innovative project gets the visibility it needs to succeed. #SupportTelcoin #CryptoAdoption #FinancialInnovation ... score: 0.6437
