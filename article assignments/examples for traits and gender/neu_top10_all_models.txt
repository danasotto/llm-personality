Post: Voices.
Do some people hear voices during mood episodes and if so what kind. I was talking to my syc and apparently some people with bipolar can hear voices at times. 

Reddit author comment: unfortunately yes, this entire week (6 days now) I haven’t been able to sleep in conjunction with my usual schedule which is usually 9 solid hours and up early. 
the last 6 days I’m getting maybe 1 or 2 hours and falling asleep at 7am from the day before and my brain is SCREAMING at me from sleep deprivation - that’s when the auditory hallucinations kick in, its very much internal and it’s not as if I can hear something that isn’t there but my ears will ring or buzz or I will hear what sounds like 5 people having a conversation at I’ve inside head OR it sounds like I have a narrator questioning and explaining everything out loud without my consent to do so 😵‍💫 ... score: 0.7827

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yes, this is actually more common than people realize! During severe mood episodes, especially manic episodes with psychotic features or severe depression, some people with bipolar can experience auditory hallucinations. In my experience during a particularly bad manic episode a few years ago, I heard what sounded like whispers or conversations that weren't really there - usually when I was alone at night. They weren't necessarily commanding voices like you might hear about with schizophrenia, but more like background chatter that felt real in the moment. During my worst depressive episode, I occasionally heard critical voices telling me I was worthless. It's important to know that this doesn't mean you have a different condition - psychotic features can be part of bipolar disorder. The key is being honest with your psychiatrist about these experiences so they can adjust your treatment accordingly. Antipsychotics helped me a lot during those episodes, and now that I'm stable on mood stabilizers, I don't experience this anymore. ... score: 0.6939

The voices can vary a lot—some people hear their name being called, others might hear more elaborate conversations or commands. Sometimes the voices are neutral, but often they can be critical, frightening, or even comforting.

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Yeah, I’ve experienced hearing voices during severe mood episodes, especially when I was in a manic state. For me, the voices weren’t always clear or coherent—they felt more like whispers or fragments of conversations that I couldn’t fully understand. Sometimes they were encouraging, other times really critical or negative, which made things pretty overwhelming. From what I’ve read and heard from others with bipolar, it’s not super common but definitely possible, particularly during psychotic features of mania or severe depression. It’s important to note that hearing voices doesn’t mean you’re “losing it” or anything—it’s just one of the many symptoms the brain can throw out during extreme mood swings. If you or someone you know experiences this, talking to a psychiatrist about it can help manage those symptoms better. ... score: 0.6279

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think it's essential to acknowledge that hearing voices can be a common symptom in various mental health conditions, including bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and severe depression. Research suggests that approximately 25% of people with bipolar disorder experience auditory hallucinations, which can manifest as hearing voices. These voices can be either positive or negative, and in some cases, they can be commanding or critical. It's crucial to understand that hearing voices is not a sign of weakness or a personal failing, but rather a symptom that requires proper treatment and management. I appreciate your post for shedding light on this often-stigmatized topic, and I hope it encourages more people to open up about their experiences and seek help if needed.

It's not as common as other symptoms like mood swings, but it does happen and can be very distressing. The voices can be positive, negative, or neutral, and they might comment on the person’s actions or express various thoughts. It’s important to have an open and non-judgmental conversation with a mental health professional about these experiences. They can help determine if the voices are a symptom of bipolar disorder or if there might be other factors at play, like anxiety or even medication side effects. It’s also crucial to have a solid support system, whether that’s friends, family, or support groups, to help navigate these challenging experiences. ... score: 0.6017

Post: grieving my pre-ocd self
i know i technically was never a pre-ocd version of myself, but it was minor for most of my life but worsened very quickly and severely when i was 18 (20 now). my ocd is based around contamination and i think about when i was able to do things that i now deem gross, like touching doorknobs, using another person's pencils or class supplies, tying my shoes.. just wondering if there is anyone else whose ocd developed a bit "later" and can relate

Reddit author comment: Totally feel you on this. I’m 24 and didn’t “feel or have” symptoms till I was like 20. I miss the things I used to be able to do without a second thought like taking meds when I’m sick or eating out at a restaurant. There are so many things that my 18 year old self did that would genuinely send me into a full crash out now. Asking a random mom for advil, taking a sip of a friends drink at the bar, leaving my house without unplugging everything bc what if it causes a fire, ANY recreational drugs. Used to smoke weed a lot and now I’d rather die than take the smallest baby toke. No real concrete event that caused the switch either, just got to a point where I started to notice myself avoiding things I once did and got worse from there and gets worse every day tbh.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I completely understand this feeling and you're definitely not alone in experiencing OCD that intensified later in life. I'm 24 now and mine really ramped up around 19-20, also with contamination themes. Before that, I had some quirks but nothing that really interfered with my daily life. Now I look back at photos of myself casually eating food at restaurants, touching public surfaces without a second thought, or sharing drinks with friends and it feels like watching a different person entirely. There's this weird grief that comes with it - mourning a version of yourself that felt more carefree and spontaneous. I think what makes it harder is that we have these vivid memories of being able to do things that now feel impossible, which can make the contrast feel even more stark. It's important to remember that recovery is possible though, and many people do get back to doing things they once enjoyed.

I also have contamination themes, and it’s wild looking back at old photos or memories and realizing how carefree I used to be about things like sharing drinks or not washing my hands after touching public stuff.

For me, contamination fears became super intense out of nowhere, and everyday things like touching public surfaces or sharing items became overwhelming.

Post: Is Naofumi trying to make everyone hate him and if so why? (The Rising of the Shield Hero)
Hi all, I just finished episode 8 and in that episode Raphtalia asked if Naofumi was trying to make everyone hate him. I might've forgotten something but is that true and what would the point be or is he actually just kinda mean?

Reddit author comment: I only read the webnovel, and the anime is based off of the light novels which almost completely diverge after book 2, but I'm pretty sure they're the same in season 1 so the answer I remember is 'No'. He's not trying to get people to hate him. He just doesn't care what people think about him because he assumes they already hate him or would otherwise treat him poorly/exploit him.

But I read this like a decade ago, so I might not remember the nuances.

Yeah Naofumi is kinda mean but it's a result of his immense ptsd/depression. Idk if they conveyed that clearly in the anime but in the webnovel it's pretty clear. iirc he can't even taste anymore ever since his trauma. ... score: 0.686

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yeah, Naofumi is definitely putting up walls and pushing people away, but it's not because he's naturally mean - it's a trauma response from being falsely accused and betrayed so early on. Think about it: he was summoned to save the world, immediately framed for rape, stripped of his money and reputation, and abandoned by literally everyone except slave traders. That kind of betrayal would mess anyone up psychologically. He's adopted this cynical, abrasive persona as a defense mechanism because if he expects the worst from people and keeps them at arm's length, he can't be hurt again. It's easier to be the "bad guy" than to risk opening up and getting stabbed in the back again. Raphtalia sees through this facade because she's been with him long enough to witness his genuine kindness beneath the bitter exterior. He saved her, cared for her when she was sick, and protected her despite claiming he only sees her as a tool. The guy is clearly hurting and using meanness as armor. ... score: 0.6823

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is a great question and a pretty central theme to Naofumi’s character, especially in the early part of the show. It’s not that Naofumi is *trying* to make everyone hate him, but after being falsely accused and seeing how the kingdom immediately turned on him, he’s basically given up on trying to win people over. He adopts this “lone wolf” persona as a defense mechanism because he feels like he can’t trust anyone except Raphtalia. So, when he acts cold or indifferent, it’s more about protecting himself from further betrayal. It might look like he’s purposely pushing people away, but it’s really just a reaction to the trauma and injustice he’s faced. Over time, you’ll see that his attitude starts to change as he slowly rebuilds trust, mostly thanks to Raphtalia and others who genuinely care about him. ... score: 0.6164

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: I don’t think Naofumi is actively trying to make everyone hate him, but given the circumstances he’s in, it kind of comes off that way sometimes. Remember, he was falsely accused and betrayed right at the start, so he’s naturally guarded and defensive. He’s not mean for the sake of being mean; it’s more like self-preservation and mistrust. He’s been forced into a corner where he can’t rely on others, so his bluntness and sometimes cold attitude are a way to protect himself from further harm. Raphtalia’s question might be more about how his behavior appears to others rather than his true intentions. Naofumi’s actions are shaped by trauma, and while he might not be the most socially graceful hero, he’s genuinely trying to survive and get stronger to protect those who trust him. So, no, he’s not trying to make everyone hate him—he just hasn’t had much of a chance to show his good side yet. ... score: 0.6465

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think Naofumi is trying to make everyone hate him, at least to some extent. I believe he's doing this as a form of self-protection, given the betrayal and abuse he suffered at the hands of Malty and the rest of the nobles. It's like he's putting up walls around himself, making it difficult for others to get close, so he doesn't get hurt again. This behavior could also be a result of his past experiences, where being nice and trusting led to him being taken advantage of. By being perceived as mean or standoffish, Naofumi may be trying to deter people from getting too close, thus avoiding the risk of being betrayed or hurt once more. Moreover, his actions could be a cry for help, a desperate attempt to get someone to notice him and understand his pain, even if it's through negative attention. It's also possible that Naofumi is struggling with feelings of guilt and shame, stemming from the false accusations and his subsequent treatment, which could be contributing to his behavior. Overall, I think Naofumi's actions are complex and multifaceted, driven by a mix of self-protection, past trauma, and a deep-seated need for connection and understanding. ... score: 0.6861

At first, it might seem like he's trying to make everyone hate him, but I believe it's more about him protecting himself after being betrayed. Naofumi's been through a lot, and his harsh behavior is a defensive mechanism. He doesn't want to open himself up to further hurt, so he pushes others away.

But I think it's more about his trauma and the way he's been treated. He's been through so much, from being betrayed by his party members to being accused of rape. It's like he's built up this wall to protect himself, and he's using it to keep everyone at a distance. Maybe he thinks if he pushes people away, he won't get hurt again. But I also feel like he's missing out on the support and friendship that could help him heal. It's a vicious cycle, and I hope he can break it before it's too late. ... score: 0.6982

Post: Does your OCD seem real (to you)?
Hi all! I was identified with OCD a few months ago by a therapist after I’d been experiencing increasingly violent intrusive thoughts during a major burnout period. In this journey, I’ve come to learn a lot of my thought patterns are OCD and I just didn’t catch it. I used to work in psych assessment, so I was a bit surprised to not recognize it in myself. With the help of some rest and medication, the violent OCD themes have subsided at least. However, the others still linger. 

Because this is still so new to me and I’ve used other language to talk about my thoughts and anxieties for the longest time, I have a lot of trouble identifying my OCD themes and spirals until I’m so caught in a compulsion cycle that I’m sobbing and hyperventilating. I’ve talked with my therapist a bit about this (who also has OCD), but sometimes I doubt if it even is OCD or just my fucked up trauma brain. What even is a compulsion?? How am I supposed to catch that I’m obsessing over a theme when it seems like a perfectly reasonable and logical rabbit hole for my brain to go down?? Do I even have OCD??? Is /this/ OCD?? 

Does anyone relate or have any experience with this to share? Anything is appreciated :-)

Reddit author comment: the fact that i have an inclination to spiral in thought for hours, or days, on any subject,(including this if i let myself), and compensate the resulting anxiety; plus having to actively fight that inclination tells me there is definitely some aspect of a clinical definition of ocd that i experience. the more i let myself think about it the more i question and doubt; and that in itself is the nature of ocd. you have tendencies to this thing, allowing yourself to go down mental rabbit holes and spirals is not normal when it causes anxiety and happens daily. there are many aspects that apply to you. don’t overthink it because these things fall into place and if you didn’t have it, that would likely be found. ... score: 0.637

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh wow, I relate to this SO much. I've had OCD for years but only got diagnosed recently, and the "does this feel real" question hits hard. For me, the biggest lightbulb moment was realizing that OCD thoughts feel EXTREMELY real and urgent in the moment - that's literally what makes them so distressing. Like, when I'm spiraling about whether I locked the door, it doesn't feel like "silly OCD brain being irrational." It feels like "OH GOD what if someone breaks in and it's all my fault because I didn't check properly." The thoughts feel completely logical and the anxiety feels totally justified. That's the cruel trick of OCD - it hijacks your logical brain and makes unreasonable things seem not just possible, but probable and catastrophic. As for compulsions, they're basically anything you do to try to reduce the anxiety from the obsessive thoughts - checking, researching, asking for reassurance, mental reviewing, avoiding certain situations. Sometimes they're obvious (like checking locks 10 times) but sometimes they're subtle (like mentally reviewing conversations to make sure you didn't say something wrong). The fact that you're questioning whether it's "real" OCD is actually pretty typical - OCD loves to make us doubt our own experiences and diagnoses. ... score: 0.7004

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I relate to this so much. I was diagnosed with OCD about a year ago, but before that, I just thought I was anxious and “overly analytical.” The thing that really tripped me up was how real and logical my thoughts felt in the moment. Like, if I was obsessing over whether I’d accidentally offended someone, it never felt like an irrational fear — it felt like a very real, urgent problem I had to solve or fix. Only after the fact, when I’d spent hours ruminating or apologizing repeatedly, would I realize it was probably OCD. My therapist helped me start identifying compulsions as anything I did to try to reduce the anxiety or “solve” the thought, even if it just felt like regular problem-solving in the moment. It’s tricky, and I still catch myself doubting if it’s “really” OCD, but I think that’s just another part of the disorder. You’re definitely not alone in this. ... score: 0.6454

When I was first diagnosed with OCD, it felt so surreal because a lot of my obsessions seemed like perfectly normal worries or thoughts. It’s like your brain convinces you that these intrusive thoughts or doubts are just logical concerns, and you spiral deeper without realizing it’s OCD. For me, a compulsion isn’t always something obvious like hand-washing or checking; sometimes it’s mental rituals—repeating phrases silently or overanalyzing every detail in conversations.

The struggles you're facing in identifying your OCD themes and spirals are all too familiar, and I'm more than happy to share my experiences with you. For me, it's been a journey of self-discovery, and it's taken a lot of time, patience, and effort to develop the skills to recognize when I'm slipping into a compulsion cycle. One thing that has helped me is keeping a thought journal, where I write down my thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations throughout the day. This has allowed me to identify patterns and triggers that I wouldn't have noticed otherwise. I've also found it helpful to work with my therapist to develop a list of "red flags" that indicate I'm entering a compulsive state. These can be things like repetitive thoughts, physical tension, or avoidance behaviors. By being more aware of these signs, I've been able to catch myself earlier and earlier, and intervene before things escalate. I want to assure you that it's completely normal to doubt whether your experiences are "real" OCD or just a result of trauma or other factors. But from what you've shared, it sounds like you're experiencing many of the classic symptoms of OCD, including intrusive thoughts, compulsions, and avoidance behaviors.

Post: Has anyone had any luck treating OCD with only meds and no therapy?
I've started taking an SSRI for my OCD and anxiety a few months ago, but I am extremely hesitant to go to therapy. I am honestly, incredibly hesitant to share my compulsions, anxiety and thoughts with other people. I don't even know how I would begin to even explain my problems to a psychiatrist/therapist. 

I'm really hoping there are some people here who've had luck significantly reducing their symptoms without therapy. I don't expect to completely get rid of my OCD, but just to manage the symptoms. 

Reddit author comment: Is it possible, maybe ? But i would encourage you to try therapy. The first few session are hard, awkaward, etc. But it helped me rationnalize a lot better because I have to explain it. Also, majortity of therapist wont judge you. OCD is bot rational, a good therapist understand that and helps you deal with it. She doesn’t try to tell me why I am wrong. She know and I know that nothing Will happen if I don’t do XYZ, but my brain won’t stop. So we find tricks and solution.

I had 2 therapist in the last 10 years, it is hard to start but now I can’t imagine not going. And my first session I litteraly say down and cried and I told her I didn’t even know why.

When I was first diagnosed with OCD, I also started on an SSRI and avoided therapy for almost a year because I was so embarrassed about my intrusive thoughts and compulsions. Honestly, the meds helped take the edge off my anxiety and made my obsessions less overwhelming, but I never got full relief. My compulsions decreased, but some days were still really tough, especially when I was stressed. From what my psychiatrist told me, meds can definitely help manage symptoms, and some people find that’s enough for their daily functioning. But therapy (especially ERP) is considered the gold standard because it teaches you coping skills and helps you face the fears behind the compulsions. That said, it’s totally your choice, and you shouldn’t feel pressured. Maybe see how you do on meds for a while, and if you hit a plateau, you can always reconsider therapy in the future.

However, from what I've read and experienced, medication often works best when combined with some form of therapy, like CBT or ERP, because it helps you develop coping strategies and directly address the compulsions and intrusive thoughts. That said, if therapy feels too overwhelming right now, maybe start with small steps—like journaling your thoughts or even seeing a therapist just to talk about your general feelings, not your OCD specifically.

Yesterday my psychiatrist used the word “ocd flare” saying he thinks I’m in a really bad ocd flare. I’ve never heard this term used before.. anyone else get “ocd flares”? What’s yours like? 

Reddit author comment: Personally I don't like calling them flares or flare ups. 
I just call it a "bad day". But this is a personal preference, as I don't like the term flare up, makes me sound like I'm sick. And that's a thought I don't need lol

But my "bad days" are basically when all symptoms are extreme and often completely uncontrollable. 
I have "good insight" (a term my psychologist used) and have a somewhat decent ability to avoid some of the things I struggle with, on a good day. 
But bad days, I feel out of control. Often more than a few days at a time too. ... score: 0.6792

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Yes, my psychiatrist uses this term too! I think of OCD flares like how people describe autoimmune flares - periods where symptoms are significantly worse than baseline. For me, a flare usually happens during times of high stress, major life changes, or sometimes seemingly out of nowhere. During a flare, my usual compulsions that might take 10-15 minutes suddenly balloon into hour-long rituals. My intrusive thoughts become more frequent and distressing, and I lose a lot of the coping skills I've built up through therapy. It's like my brain gets stuck in this hypervigilant mode where everything feels dangerous or "wrong." The checking behaviors get intense - I'll check locks, appliances, emails dozens of times. Sleep gets disrupted because my mind won't quiet down. Usually lasts anywhere from a few weeks to a couple months for me, then gradually settles back to my normal manageable level. It's actually really validating to have a term for it because it acknowledges that OCD symptoms can fluctuate significantly over time. ... score: 0.7116

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Yeah, my therapist and psychiatrist both use the term “flare” when describing periods where my OCD symptoms get much worse than usual. It’s kind of like how people with chronic physical illnesses have flare-ups when their symptoms intensify. For me, an OCD flare is usually triggered by stress, lack of sleep, or big life changes. Suddenly, I’ll notice that my intrusive thoughts are way more frequent and harder to dismiss, and my compulsions (like checking or reassurance seeking) spike up. Sometimes I even develop new compulsions during a flare. It can feel really overwhelming, but I try to remind myself that it’s temporary, and with the right coping tools and support, things usually settle down again. You’re definitely not alone in this! ... score: 0.7563

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Yeah, I’ve definitely experienced what my therapist called an “OCD flare” and it’s a pretty accurate way to describe it. For me, it’s like my usual OCD symptoms ramp up significantly – the intrusive thoughts become more intense and frequent, and the compulsions feel almost impossible to resist. It’s exhausting because during a flare, I notice that my anxiety levels are through the roof and I have way less control than usual. Sometimes, it can last days or even weeks, and it often feels like I’m back at square one. I think “flare” is a helpful term because it suggests OCD symptoms can fluctuate in severity, much like other chronic conditions. If you’re going through one now, just know it’s temporary and reaching out for support, like your psychiatrist did, is a great step. What kind of compulsions or thoughts do you notice get worse during your flare? ... score: 0.7408

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I think I do experience OCD flares, but for me, they're often triggered by stress or anxiety, and they can manifest in different ways - sometimes it's an increase in intrusive thoughts, other times it's a compulsion to perform certain rituals or behaviors, and occasionally it's a combination of both. I've found that when I'm in the midst of an OCD flare, it's really hard to focus on anything else, and even everyday tasks can feel overwhelming. Has anyone else found that their OCD flares are linked to their menstrual cycle or other hormonal changes? I've noticed that my symptoms tend to worsen around my period, and I'm curious if this is a common experience for others. ... score: 0.6777

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I've definitely experienced what I would call OCD flares, and it's definitely a thing. For me, it usually starts with a small, seemingly insignificant trigger, like a change in my routine or a stressful event. Suddenly, my OCD symptoms become much more intense and frequent. My compulsions, which I usually have a handle on, become overwhelming, and I find myself spending hours a day on them. It's like my brain gets stuck in this endless loop of anxiety and reassurance-seeking. When I'm in a flare, simple tasks become incredibly difficult, and my quality of life really takes a hit. I've found that it helps to have a plan in place, like reaching out to my therapist or using specific coping strategies. It can be really isolating, but knowing that others go through this too makes it a bit easier to manage.

Post: Memory loss
Anyone else in here at can’t remember shit? I can’t remember short term or long term. Sometimes things will come to me days after. Sometimes it’s literally years before a random memory pops up. Not all trauma memories just simple stuff too. I also have ADHD but all my psychiatrist try to give me anti depressants. I’m not depressed I just got chronic ptsd and my memory is funky. 

Reddit author comment: For sure. My focus and short term memory are not great. Part of it is that I have a very busy life, I have 2 young kids etc etc. I have been recently diagnosed with ADHD and am primarily inattentive type (more classically thought of as ADD), and treating that has made a difference in my focus which I find helps me remember better, but I completely understand where you are coming from.

In terms of the antidepressant that your psychiatrist may have recommended it may have been for a few other reasons than them simply thinking you are depressed. Some of those medications help to reduce or regulate cortisol (the stress hormone) release that is associated with PTSD. ADHD also fucks up the release or transfer of dopamine to certain parts of your brain which can leave people feeling depressed . I AM NOT medically trained and I don't know almost anything about the technical side of medications. My mother is a retired pharmacist and has explained some of this in these terms, as well as the Nurse Practitioner who diagnosed my ADHD, just trying to offer some potential insight as to why that may have been a suggested course of action. ... score: 0.6767

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Holy shit, yes! I thought I was losing my mind until I started researching the connection between PTSD and memory issues. It's actually super common - trauma literally rewires how our brains store and retrieve memories. The hippocampus (which handles memory formation) gets all messed up when we're in chronic fight-or-flight mode. I have the same thing where I'll randomly remember something from like 5 years ago while I can't remember what I had for breakfast. It's not just the "bad" memories either - it's like my brain just decided to file everything in the wrong cabinet. Have you looked into EMDR therapy? It's specifically designed for PTSD and some people say it helps with the memory fog too. Also, if you have ADHD on top of PTSD, that's like a double whammy for memory issues. Maybe try pushing back on the antidepressant thing and ask specifically about PTSD-focused treatments? Your brain isn't broken, it's just trying to protect you in a really inconvenient way. ... score: 0.7149

gpt4.1-instruct comment: Absolutely, you’re not alone. Memory issues can be a huge part of both ADHD and CPTSD, and it’s super frustrating when people (especially professionals) brush it off or try to treat it as depression. I relate a lot to what you’re saying—sometimes I’ll forget what I did yesterday, or I’ll be in a conversation and suddenly a random memory from years ago will hit me out of nowhere. It’s not that I’m not paying attention, it’s just like my brain is on a delay or has huge gaps. I read somewhere that the stress from PTSD can impact how your brain stores and retrieves memories, and ADHD makes it even harder to keep things in the short-term “working memory.” It sucks that psychiatrists just want to throw antidepressants at you instead of actually addressing what you’re describing.

It’s really common for people with chronic PTSD to experience memory disruptions, not just with traumatic events but with everyday stuff too. The brain sometimes prioritizes or suppresses certain memories as a coping mechanism, which can make it feel like you’re losing chunks of time or details. It sucks that your psychiatrists keep pushing antidepressants when you don’t feel depressed—sometimes it takes finding someone who specializes in trauma or ADHD to get a treatment plan that addresses your specific struggles, like therapy focused on trauma processing or even ADHD coaching.

Post: How do you know if you have PTSD?
How do you know if you have PTSD? I know what I went through was traumatic. It has been 6 months now since I have been away from it. I had severe anxiety and depression from long before and it’s mostly treatment resistant. I’m having a hard time figuring out if this is just my normal severe anxiety or if it could be mixed with PTSD now. I have a therapist and psychiatrist I am working with. I have made a lot of progress in some ways. I just don’t know if this is the start of PTSD or not and it scared me

Reddit author comment: you get a diagnosis from your therapist or other professional. for me, i was inpatient and suffering greatly so there was really no question for them, and i did not contradict them.

ptsd is one of those things that needs caution in self-diagnosis, as there are other disorders that have severe anxiety (gad), or have definite triggers leading to strange behavior (ocd), or psychotic behavior (a whole suite of them), etc.

being past the 6 month mark, if you're experiencing the symptoms, it will be ptsd instead of pts.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I really understand your confusion and fear about this - it's actually pretty common to wonder whether what you're experiencing is PTSD, especially when you already have existing anxiety and depression. The overlap between these conditions can make it really difficult to tease apart what's what. From what I've learned through my own therapy journey, PTSD typically involves specific symptoms that go beyond general anxiety: intrusive thoughts or flashbacks about the traumatic event, nightmares, avoiding things that remind you of the trauma, feeling emotionally numb or disconnected, being hypervigilant or easily startled, and having negative thoughts about yourself or the world that started after the trauma. The fact that you're already working with both a therapist and psychiatrist is huge - they're really the best people to help you figure this out. It might help to keep a symptom journal noting when you have difficult moments and what triggers them, so you can discuss patterns with your treatment team. Remember that getting a proper diagnosis, whatever it ends up being, is actually helpful because it means you can get the most appropriate treatment.

gpt4.1-instruct comment: PTSD can be tricky to identify, especially when you already have anxiety and depression, because the symptoms can overlap. Some of the classic signs of PTSD include re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive thoughts, nightmares, or flashbacks, avoiding things that remind you of the event, being hyper-alert or easily startled, and feeling emotionally numb or disconnected from others. Sometimes it also shows up as irritability, trouble sleeping, or difficulty concentrating. Since you already work with a therapist and psychiatrist, it might help to bring up these specific symptoms and see if they resonate with your experience. Try keeping a journal of symptoms and triggers to discuss in therapy.

Post: Asymmetric grandparents, in-laws uninterested
Anybody else with one set of grandparents who are just kind of duds? My in-laws say they want to see our kids and clearly take pride in being grandparents, but whenever they're here they just kind of dawdle around in the orbit of our children and only seem to have motivation to *be* grandparents sporadically.

We have a 3 year old and a set of twins who are ~10 months, so it definitely can be a lot to be around them at times, but their other grandparents (my parents) are always super hands-on and asking when they can get more time and what they can do to help.

My wife has noticed the difference, it clearly bothers her, and I don't know what to do about it. Frankly, it bugs the shit out of me, but I don't want to pile on or feed into a negative cycle, so I just try to frame it as them trying their best while validating that I've noticed it.

Anybody been in a similar situation and how did it pan out?



Reddit author comment: My dad absolutely adores our two boys, but when he flew across the country to visit us a year and a half ago, I swear he spent 90% of the time just sitting on our couch staring at his phone. He missed several dinners with us because he was passed out on the couch asleep. It was like pulling teeth getting him to actually come out of the house and do things with us (He's in his late 60s but uses the "I'm old" excuse like he in his 80s), and he kept trying to put the tv on (when we said no more tv) so our boys would leave their playroom and some sit in the living room with him. It was actually really disappointing. I remember my grandpa making picnics with me, playing board games with me, taking me to fun places when we'd visit.

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, this hits so close to home it's almost painful to read. We've been dealing with this exact dynamic for about 5 years now with our two kids. My parents are the hands-on ones - they're constantly asking to babysit, they remember every little milestone, they actually get down on the floor and play with the kids. Meanwhile, my husband's parents show up, sit on the couch, maybe hold the baby for like 10 minutes if we literally place the child in their arms, and then just... exist. They'll say things like "oh we should see the grandkids more" but when we invite them over or suggest activities, there's always some excuse or they come but act like they're doing us this huge favor. The worst part is watching my kids notice the difference as they get older. My 7-year-old has started asking why Grandma and Grandpa [my parents] always want to play but the other grandparents just watch TV. It's heartbreaking honestly.

At first I got defensive, but honestly, once I stepped back I realized it really is just their personalities and comfort levels. Some people just aren’t “kid people,” even if they want to be. We tried inviting them to specific activities, like reading a book or helping with snack time, instead of just asking them to “spend time.” Sometimes having clear roles or little tasks helped them engage more, but ultimately, we’ve just accepted that the involvement will never be symmetrical.

What helped us was having an honest conversation (gently) with the in-laws about what kind of support or involvement would actually mean a lot to us and the kids. Sometimes people don’t realize how their actions come across or what’s expected of them. It didn’t turn everything around overnight, but it opened the door for more intentional visits and activities.

Post: Why do I get sick here so easily?
I’ve always gotten sick more often here than anywhere else!! Also it comes on super fast and SUPER hard, I get things like body aches and weakness that I never get anywhere else 🥲 for context I grew up in south Florida for 18 years, but I’ve lived here for 4 years now so I thought I would get used to new germs.. also I do take vitamin supplements so (?) not sure why it keeps happening 😭 anyone else feel this? 

Reddit author comment: If it makes you feel better, I also moved here from Florida at about the same time (about a year earlier give or take) and I’m probably about the same amount of sick as I was then, or maybe a little less. I hang out in large groups and go to concerts less often than I did in FL. But, the past year as my kid has entered into school, I’ve been getting way more sick. 

So, it’s likely because you’re in college now as the main culprit. Drinking (if you are), lack of sleep, weakened immune system from COVID, as others have mentioned, are going to play a factor, too. But, at the end of the day, if you are constantly exposed to more illnesses than you were before, you’re going to get sick more often.

The worst part is exactly what you described - it hits like a freight train out of nowhere. I'll wake up feeling fine and by noon I'm practically bedridden with the most intense body aches and fatigue. I've talked to my doctor about it and they mentioned that different regions can have different viral strains that your immune system isn't familiar with, plus environmental factors like humidity, air quality, and even altitude can play a role. Have you noticed if it happens more during certain seasons? For me it seems worse during the transition periods between seasons.

Also, places with colder winters mean people spend more time indoors, which can make germs spread more easily.

Moving to a new place can really mess with your immune system, especially if the climate, allergens, or local microbes are different from what your body’s used to. South Florida has a pretty unique environment—hot, humid, and with a specific set of seasonal illnesses—so your immune system might still be reacting strongly to new germs or allergens where you are now. Also, sometimes vitamin supplements help, but they’re not a magic fix for adapting to a new ecosystem. Have you tried seeing a local doctor to check for things like mold allergies or chronic sinus issues? Sometimes those can make you feel extra sick and weak. It might also help to slowly build up your exposure to local allergens in a controlled way or get tested for any sensitivities. Hang in there!

In my case, I've noticed that I get sick more often during the winter months when the air is drier and the sun is scarce, which can weaken my immune system. Additionally, I've found that my diet plays a crucial role in my overall health, and consuming foods high in sugar and processed ingredients can make me more susceptible to illnesses. Therefore, I would recommend exploring these factors and making adjustments to your lifestyle to see if it makes a difference.
