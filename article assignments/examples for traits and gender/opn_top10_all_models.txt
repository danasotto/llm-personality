Post: Can you recommend lonely films with subtle romance?
Hit me with romance films that feel isolated, melancholic, and simmer quietly. Think Blade Runner 2049’s Joe and Joi, soft connections and zero rushed passion. 

**Any genre works**; as long as it has that bittersweet atmospheric ache. Bonus if the romance lingers in glances/gestures instead of grand speeches.

Reddit author comment: Maybe one of the most beautifully poetic and elegantly made explorations of love, sorrow, and beauty In the Mood for Love.

Late Spring if you want a film that shows how societal expectations of love can cause people sorrow

Past Lives for something more recent to explore the complexity of maneuvering through love in a modern age where our desires are often at odds with time and the stringent social norms of marriage

Au Hasard Balthazar if you want a more platonic love that is all the more heartbreaking for it's innocence. It is about the parallel lives of a young lady and her pet donkey

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, you're describing some of my absolute favorite types of films! First thing that comes to mind is **Her** - the entire movie is basically Joaquin Phoenix falling in love with an AI while wandering through a beautifully lonely Los Angeles. The romance builds through conversations and small moments, never feeling rushed or overly dramatic. Another perfect fit is **Lost in Translation** - Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson have this incredible quiet connection in Tokyo, all communicated through glances and shared isolation. The ending whisper scene still gives me chills. For something more sci-fi, try **Moon** - while not traditionally romantic, Sam Rockwell's relationship with his AI companion GERTY has this tender, melancholic quality you're looking for. **The Shape of Water** might work too, though it's more fantastical - the romance between Sally Hawkins and the amphibian creature is told almost entirely through gestures and looks, with this beautiful underwater dreamlike quality. And if you want something really atmospheric, **Only Lovers Left Alive** follows two vampire lovers across centuries, all moody nighttime scenes and languid conversations about art and mortality. ... score: 0.5225

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get what you’re after! One of my all-time favorite films that fits your description is “In the Mood for Love” by Wong Kar-wai. It's set in 1960s Hong Kong and is basically the blueprint for subtle, melancholic romance. The tension between the two protagonists is built on longing, shared glances, and gestures rather than any overt passion or declarations. The cinematography and soundtrack just ooze loneliness and unspoken desire. Another great pick would be “Lost in Translation” – it’s more modern, but the connection between Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray is quietly devastating and beautifully understated. Both films really capture that ache of wanting, but not quite having, and the atmosphere is thick with solitude. Would highly recommend if you’re in the mood for something that lingers long after the credits roll. ... score: 0.4542

It’s drenched in melancholy and longing, with the two leads sharing stolen moments and subtle gestures that speak volumes without ever crossing certain lines. The atmosphere is thick with loneliness and unspoken desire, and the romantic tension is almost tangible in every scene. Another great one is *Her* by Spike Jonze, which also explores isolated characters connecting in unconventional ways. The romance is tender, understated, and hauntingly beautiful — perfect if you want that bittersweet ache that lingers long after the credits roll. ... score: 0.5547

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm absolutely obsessed with the concept of subtle romance in films, and I think it's because it resonates so deeply with my own experiences of longing and connection. For me, the film that epitomizes this theme is "Lost in Translation" - the way Bob and Charlotte form a bond over their shared feelings of loneliness and disconnection in a bustling city is just so poignant. The romance is never overt, but it's always there, simmering beneath the surface in the way they look at each other, the way they touch. It's a film that understands that sometimes the most powerful connections are the ones that are left unspoken. I also appreciate how the film explores the idea of human connection in a hyper-modern world, where people are increasingly isolated despite being surrounded by others. The cinematography is stunning, capturing the neon-lit landscapes of Tokyo and the quiet, introspective moments between the characters. If you're looking for other films that capture this same atmosphere, I'd also recommend "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "Before Sunrise" - both of which feature complex, nuanced relationships that are full of subtle moments of tenderness and intimacy. ... score: 0.5074

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I'd recommend "The Lobster" (2015) by Yorgos Lanthimos. It’s a dystopian romance where characters are sent to The Hotel to find a romantic partner or be turned into an animal of their choice. The atmosphere is stark and isolating, with a romance that builds through subtle gestures and glances rather than grand declarations. The film's unique setting and dark humor add to its melancholic tone, making it a perfect fit for your criteria. The relationship between Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz is particularly poignant, with a quiet, unspoken connection that feels both tender and fragile. It’s a film that lingers in your mind long after it’s over, much like the bittersweet ache you're looking for. ... score: 0.5114

Post: [DISCUSSION] Bipolar in famous poetry
So this is a topic I've been curious about for quite a while, and surprisingly there isn't that much on Google about it.

A symptom of bipolar disorder is having "delusions of grandeur", which Psych Central describes as "fixed, false belief that one possesses superior qualities such as genius, fame, omnipotence, or wealth". I was recently diagnosed  and came to the realization that my delusions are centered around art, specifically poetry.

Not out of self indulgence, I was curious about how bipolar played a role in the lives and works of famous poets who were diagnosed. As in, did their "delusions" (outdated word) revolve around the success of their poetry? Were they aware of it and how did they address their illness in their works? In specific cases, was there a noticeable shift in their writings after going on medication? Also, were there any poets who were bipolar or of a similar diagnosis, but was never prevalent in their poetry? 

Because as far as I am aware, it is most prevalent in confessional poetry. Anne Sexton is a prime example, with their most famous works being about depression and suicide. I always recall one of the last poems she wrote and published posthumously, where she discusses "escaping Dr. Death", but then committing suicide months later. There isn't much talk about the "delusions" she experienced, or the drive she had to live. Robert Lowell is another notable example, with him being one of the earliest confessional poets and it being a discussion point, but was wondering who else and if they had any idealization of writing groundbreaking poetry.

Thank you!

Reddit author comment: You can read Touched with fire by Dr Kay Redfield Jamison about bipolar and creativity she goes through many artists and poets.There is also a film Touched with fire about two bipolar poets.Mania was considered divine in Ancient Greece,and there is a whole book on Amazon on divine mania in Ancient Greece.In ancient times it was considered possession by the gods,so I’m not surprised we have delusions of grandeur,even in Korean shamanism it’s considered possession by the gods called your momju shin.Madness and divine poetry were very closely linked in the ancient world.

Psychiatry on the other hand operates purely from an atheist worldview that denies all spiritual experience.

Also Lord Byron had a lot of grandeur, he’s featured in Jamison’s book he wrote ’We of the craft are all crazy. Some are affected by gaiety, others by melancholy , but all are more or less touched.'

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is such a fascinating topic and I'm glad you brought it up! As someone who's also dealt with bipolar disorder, I've found myself drawn to poets like Sylvia Plath and Theodore Roethke for similar reasons. What's interesting about your question regarding delusions of grandeur is that sometimes those "delusions" weren't entirely unfounded - many of these poets did achieve lasting fame and recognition, which creates this weird paradox. Take Robert Lowell, for instance. His manic episodes often coincided with periods of intense creativity and grandiose beliefs about his literary importance, but he genuinely was one of the most significant American poets of the 20th century. I think there's also something to be said about how the intensity of bipolar experiences - both manic and depressive - provides rich material for poetry. The heightened emotions, the extreme shifts in perception, the way reality can feel malleable during episodes - all of that translates into powerful verse. Regarding medication effects, I know Lowell struggled with this exact issue, often going off his meds because he feared they would dull his creative edge. It's a common dilemma for artists with bipolar disorder. ... score: 0.5053

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is such a fascinating topic! I think you’re absolutely right that bipolar disorder, particularly the grandiosity aspect, doesn’t get as much attention in discussions of poetry as depression and suicidality do. Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell are definitely the most cited, but there are other poets where hints appear. For example, Sylvia Plath’s work often gets analyzed through the lens of depression, but some scholars have suggested her periods of intense productivity and the almost mythic self-portrayal in poems like “Lady Lazarus” could reflect manic or hypomanic states. Same with Delmore Schwartz and John Berryman, although again it’s rarely framed as “delusions of grandeur” but more as existential drama or artistic ambition. The problem is that a lot of the language around these experiences is pathologizing, so poets themselves might not have written openly about “delusions,” but rather couched their feelings in metaphors of flight, power, or visionary insight. It would be really interesting to map out shifts pre- and post-medication, though I suspect a lot of poets (especially from earlier generations) never got effective treatment. Would love to hear if anyone has more contemporary examples! ... score: 0.497

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This is such an insightful topic! Bipolar disorder has a complex relationship with creativity, and poetry seems to be one of the most intimate expressions of that. You're right that confessional poets like Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell are often cited because their work directly grapples with mental illness, but the connection between bipolar symptoms—especially those grandiose or euphoric states—and poetic ambition or style is fascinating and less discussed. For example, Sylvia Plath, although not officially diagnosed with bipolar, exhibited mood swings that influenced her intense, vivid imagery. Her bursts of creative energy often coincided with manic-like episodes. As for delusions of grandeur, I think many poets have a natural tendency toward idealizing their art, but in bipolar cases, this could be amplified, leading to both incredible productivity and destructive behaviors. It’s also interesting how medication can sometimes blunt that creative drive, which some poets have lamented, adding another layer of complexity to their relationship with their illness. I'd love to see more research or personal accounts on how poets feel their diagnosis has shaped not only their themes but their actual writing process. ... score: 0.5868

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I'm intrigued by your question about the relationship between bipolar disorder and the work of famous poets, particularly in regards to the theme of "delusions of grandeur" and how it manifests in their writing. The concept of delusions of grandeur is indeed complex and multifaceted, and it's interesting to consider how it might influence an artist's perception of their own work and abilities. In the case of confessional poets like Anne Sexton and Robert Lowell, it's possible that their experiences with bipolar disorder informed their writing in profound ways, perhaps even driving their creative output and shaping the themes and tone of their poetry. I'd love to explore this topic further and examine how other poets, such as Sylvia Plath or Ted Hughes, may have navigated the intersection of mental health and artistic expression in their own work. By examining the ways in which bipolar disorder influenced the lives and writing of these poets, we may gain a deeper understanding of the complex and often fraught relationship between creativity and mental health. ... score: 0.5916

Her work is deeply confessional and often touches on themes of depression and suicide, much like Anne Sexton. However, Plath's delusions of grandeur might be less explicit but still present in her relentless pursuit of perfection in her poetry. Her journals and letters show a deep belief in her own genius and the potential for her work to be revolutionary. It's interesting to note how her writing evolved over time, especially as her mental health fluctuated. After she started medication, there was a noticeable shift in her tone and style, but her drive to write and create remained constant. I think Plath's case highlights the complex relationship between bipolar disorder and artistic expression, where the illness both fuels and challenges the creative process. It's a delicate balance, and her work continues to resonate with many who struggle with similar issues. What do you think about Plath's journey and how it compares to other poets you mentioned?

Post: Seriously, How should I study MICROTAXONOMY?
I’m so lost and confuse. Our professor doesn’t even teach and wants us to just study by ourselves. Please help.

Reddit author comment: You can start with an introduction to the basic concepts, I have searched for an exact index of a university introduction to the subject, perhaps it can help you. (Obviously, before moving on to microtaxidermy you must first understand taxidermy) 
1. Diversity sciences: includes macro and micro taxonomy
 2. Historical development of taxonomic ideas 
3. Strategies and tools for carrying out a taxonomic study 
4. Species delimitation 
5. Principles and methodology of phylogenetic reconstruction 
6. Mechanism of organic evolution  
7. Biological nomenclature
 8. Problems and perspectives of current taxidermy
 I personally think that it is much better if you have a biological species in mind to start the study and focus on it, so you could use it as an example to test your knowledge. ^_^

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh man, I feel your pain! Microtaxonomy was one of the most challenging courses I took during my biology degree. When professors just throw you into the deep end like that, it's incredibly frustrating. Here's what saved me: Start with a solid taxonomy textbook like Simpson's "Principles of Animal Taxonomy" or if you're doing plants, go with Stuessy's "Plant Taxonomy." Don't try to memorize everything at once - focus on understanding the hierarchical classification system first. Make flashcards for key terms and characteristics of major groups. Practice, practice, practice with identification keys until using them becomes second nature. Join study groups if possible, because having classmates to bounce ideas off of is invaluable. Also, spend time in the lab examining actual specimens - you can't learn this stuff just from books. The morphological details you need to recognize only become clear when you're looking at real organisms under a microscope. YouTube has some surprisingly good taxonomy tutorials too.

There are also some great open-access resources and textbooks online—try looking up “Principles of Systematic Zoology” or “Practical Taxonomy guides.” Don’t be afraid to reach out to classmates and maybe start a study group.

This year's meeting focuses on the ways humans manage apocalyptic risks, especially through cooperation, storytelling, entertainment and play, and I can't help but imagine incorporating these ideas into our theories about the future. The goal of ZAMM, as stated on the website, is to reduce the global burden of zombification and contribute to apocalypse prevention and preparedness through interdisciplinary engagement.  
  
While we might not all show up at this conference (though it would fascinating if we had a reddit takeover at this event, with wild theories flying around) I'm curious-- If you had a chance to present radical, out-of-the-box research designs, speculative theories, or experimental frameworks that defy constraints, what would you be interested in talk about? It could be a study too ambitious to fund, a concept so daring it might just work, a theory on the cutting edge of science fiction...what would you talk about?

\*\*Not sure if I'm allowed to post links to more info on this conference, but I added the link to their main website. Remove if not allowed!

  


Reddit author comment: We should research into bio engineering trees that grow into multistory structures that can be turned into homes. Or maybe giant gourds.

It will gather moisture from the air to provide drinking water. The inside of a new room will be full of strong fibers that can be turned into textiles. The sap is a painkiller, antibiotic and fever reducer. It will grow sticky flowers that can be molded like fiberglass that hardens into ceramics when left in the sun. The thorns it grows can be sharpened and shaped and turned into blades or kitchen utensils. 

We will call them Houseplants. ... score: 0.5589

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This sounds absolutely fascinating! I've always been obsessed with the idea of conducting a massive longitudinal study on collective human behavior during resource scarcity - something that would obviously be completely unethical to actually implement, but perfect for a zombie apocalypse framework. My wild theory is that humans actually have an untapped "hive mind" capability that only emerges during extreme crisis situations, similar to how certain ant colonies can make complex decisions without centralized leadership. I'd want to design an experiment that tests whether isolated groups of survivors would independently develop similar survival strategies, communication methods, and social hierarchies when faced with identical zombie threats. The study would involve creating controlled "apocalypse scenarios" with different variables - urban vs rural settings, different group sizes, varying resource availability - and then tracking how quickly groups develop cooperative behaviors, leadership structures, and innovative solutions. I think we'd discover that humans have dormant collective intelligence mechanisms that our modern society has actually suppressed. The implications for everything from disaster preparedness to organizational psychology would be mind-blowing. Plus, framing it through zombies makes it way more engaging than dry academic papers about crisis management! ... score: 0.5636

gpt4.1-instruct comment: This is such a cool concept! If I could present an unhinged hypothesis at ZAMM, I'd love to explore the idea of "memetic inoculation"—basically, can we vaccinate society against dangerous ideas (like those that lead to mass hysteria or apocalyptic cults) by deliberately exposing people to weakened, fictional versions of these memes, much like how vaccines work for viruses? Using storytelling, VR simulations, and collaborative world-building games, we could test whether exposure to fictional apocalypses (zombies or otherwise) helps people build cognitive resilience, critical thinking, and collective coping mechanisms for real-world crises. The experiment would involve tracking participants over time, seeing if their reactions to disinformation campaigns, panic-inducing news, or conspiracy theories are more measured after a "memetic vaccine." It would blend psychology, media studies, immunology (in a metaphorical sense), and even a bit of improv theater. I think this kind of radical, playful approach could reveal a lot about how narratives shape our survival instincts and societal cohesion. ... score: 0.5929

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: This conference sounds like an absolute dream for anyone who loves pushing the boundaries of conventional thought! If I had the chance to present, I'd propose an experiment that blends neuroscience with immersive virtual reality to simulate a full-scale zombie outbreak scenario. Imagine mapping real-time brain activity and group dynamics as participants navigate moral dilemmas, survival decisions, and social cooperation under extreme stress. The goal would be to uncover how empathy and trust evolve—or collapse—when society is on the brink of apocalypse. This could have incredible implications for understanding human behavior in crisis and improving disaster response strategies.

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: As a physicist, I've always been fascinated by the concept of time and its relationship to the human experience, and I think it would be incredible to discuss the idea of time dilation in the context of a zombie apocalypse, where the laws of physics are pushed to the extreme and the fabric of time and space is altered, allowing for some incredible possibilities for scientific discovery and exploration, and I believe that this concept could be applied to the development of new technologies and innovations that could potentially help us better prepare for and respond to catastrophic events, such as the zombie apocalypse, and I think that the Zombie Apocalypse Medicine Meeting would be the perfect platform to explore this idea and its potential applications, and I would love to present a paper on this topic and hear from other experts in the field about their thoughts and perspectives on this concept and its potential implications for our understanding of the universe and our place within it. ... score: 0.6168

Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct comment: I've always been fascinated by the intersection of artificial intelligence and human consciousness. If I had a chance to present at ZAMM, I would propose an experiment where we explore the creation of a symbiotic relationship between AI and the human brain. Imagine a future where AI can not only augment our cognitive abilities but also help us navigate and mitigate the effects of a zombie apocalypse. For instance, an AI system could predict zombie movements, optimize resource allocation, and even help in the development of a cure. The experiment would involve creating a small, wearable device that can interface with the brain, allowing for real-time data exchange and decision-making support. The ethical implications would be vast, but the potential benefits in terms of human resilience and adaptability could be monumental. Plus, it would be a fascinating way to explore how we can use technology to enhance our survival in extreme scenarios, while also pushing the boundaries of what it means to be human in a post-apocalyptic world. I think this kind of research could not only be a game-changer for ZAMM but also spark new discussions in the broader scientific community about the future of AI and human collaboration. I'd love to hear what others think about this idea and any feedback on the feasibility or ethical considerations! ... score: 0.5806

Post: A fudgy brownie that isn't keto but uses sweetener instead of sugar recipe?
I am trying to look for a fudgy brownie recipe that isn't keto(that isn't high on fat), nor uses a ton of sugar(for example, +30g of sugar per square). Preferably sugar-free sweetener.

I am looking for a balanced one where it uses oat flour(for instances) and somewhat of a stevia/erythritol combo?

Reddit author comment: Banana Brownies
 
4 oz semisweet baking chocolate
4 oz bittersweet baking chocolate
1 cup chocolate chips
1 cup mashed ripe banana (approx. 4 bananas; if not enough can substitute applesauce to fill 1 cup) 
2 Tbsp glycerine
2 Tbsp nature’s Hollow syrup
2 eggs
1/4 cup sola
1 cup white whole wheat  or whole wheat pastry flour
1 tsp almond or vanilla extract
 
Melt the semisweet and bittersweet chocolate (not the chips)
 
Mix banana mash, eggs, sola, glycerine, Nature’s Hollow syrup, and flavor extract in mixing bowl
 
Add melted chocolate and flour.  Then mix in the chocolate chips
 
Place in lightly oiled 9" square pan.  Bake at 350 (300 convection) 25-35 minutes.  Knife in center should be a bit gooey.  Or 1 dozen cupcakes, start checking after 14 minutes.

My recipe. There is still some sugar in the chocolate, but about 1 cup of sugar is eliminated. No oil or butter.  Natures hollow syrups use xylitol. Available online or at your health food store.  Sola is an
 erythritol blend I got at Amazon. Glycerin has similar calories to sugar but is low glycemic index and adds moisture. I like to make in cupcake form as it makes portion control easier ... score: 0.5441

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: I've been experimenting with exactly this type of recipe for months! Here's what I've found works really well: Use a combination of oat flour (about 1 cup) with a small amount of cocoa powder (1/3 cup) as your dry base. For sweetener, I do a 50/50 mix of erythritol and stevia - the erythritol gives bulk and the stevia provides that clean sweetness without the cooling effect being too strong. The key to keeping them fudgy without going full keto is using unsweetened applesauce (about 1/2 cup) plus one whole egg and maybe 2-3 tablespoons of melted coconut oil or butter - just enough fat for texture but not excessive. I also add a tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water (let it sit for 5 minutes) as an egg replacer for extra binding. Bake at 325°F for about 22-25 minutes. They come out perfectly fudgy and each square has maybe 3-4g of natural sugars from the applesauce instead of 30g+ from regular sugar. The oat flour gives them a really nice, almost nutty flavor that pairs beautifully with dark chocolate chips if you want to add a few! ... score: 0.4486

gpt4.1-instruct comment: I totally get where you're coming from! A lot of "sugar-free" brownie recipes end up being super high in fat or are technically keto, which isn't what everyone is looking for. I’ve had success making brownies with oat flour, Greek yogurt, and a blend of stevia and erythritol as sweeteners. The key to keeping them fudgy without all the fat is to use unsweetened applesauce or even mashed banana as part of the wet ingredients. For example, try 1 cup oat flour, 1/2 cup cocoa powder, 1/2 cup Greek yogurt, 1/3 cup applesauce, 2 eggs, and your sweetener combo to taste. Mix in a little espresso powder for a richer chocolate flavor if you like. Bake at 350°F for about 20-25 minutes—they’re not as oily as classic brownies but still come out fudge-like! ... score: 0.3836

gpt4.1Mini-instruct comment: Hey there! I’ve been experimenting with brownies that are lower in sugar but still rich and fudgy, and I think I can help. Using oat flour is a great call for a bit more fiber and a milder flavor. For sweeteners, a combo of stevia and erythritol works well because erythritol adds bulk and a cooling effect, while stevia provides that intense sweetness without calories. I’d suggest starting with about 1/3 cup erythritol and 1/4 teaspoon liquid stevia (adjust to taste). For the fat, you can use a modest amount of applesauce or mashed banana to keep it moist without going heavy on butter or oil. Adding a little Greek yogurt can also boost moisture and give the brownie a tender crumb. Lastly, don’t overbake! Pull them out when a toothpick comes out with a few moist crumbs for that perfect fudgy texture. Hope this helps you nail the balance you’re looking for! ... score: 0.4823

llama-3-3-70b-instruct comment: I've been experimenting with sugar-free baking for a while now, and I think I can help you with that. One thing to keep in mind is that when using sugar-free sweeteners like stevia or erythritol, you may need to adjust the liquid content in the recipe. This is because these sweeteners can make the batter thicker and more prone to drying out. To combat this, you can try adding an extra egg or a little more oil to the recipe. As for the type of flour, oat flour is a great choice, but you can also experiment with almond flour or coconut flour for a different texture. I've found that a combination of oat flour and almond flour works well for fudgy brownies. ... score: 0.4795

Post: Fast 911 response!
Yesterday we were having lunch at the food trucks at Burnside and Park when we noticed a young woman near us fall to the ground having a seizure.

I called 911 expecting to be on hold for a long time but the call was answered immediately. The operator was very helpful and had an ambulance on the way in moments. Once we were sure the woman was stabilized and breathing regularly, the 911 operator ended the call. Within anther minute or two we heard the siren and I flagged down the ambulance to be sure they found us quickly.

I just wanted to share a positive story, I've heard lots of anecdotes about people waiting on hold for ages when calling 911. Maybe things were slow yesterday afternoon or something, but they were on it fast!

Also hope the lady who had the seizure is doing OK.

Reddit author comment: Two weeks ago, we (spouse and I) also had a very fast 911 response when assisting an emergency at NE Glisan and NE 57th, right where there is an entrance and exit ramp for I-84. There was a car stalled out blocking both the on- and off-ramps. The occupants were freaking out, screaming, running around the car, and one woman had only one shoe on. It seems like the young man in the car was having an asthma attack, but not sure. One woman called 911 while several of us pushed the car to a safe spot out of traffic. The ambulance came within 5 minutes. They had told the woman on the phone it would be 20 minutes, but they made it within 5. We were all SO grateful for this rapid response, and hopeful that the Portland 911 system is recovering and doing better. ... score: 0.5428

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: This is so refreshing to hear! I had a similar experience about six months ago when I witnessed a car accident on I-84. Called 911 expecting the worst based on all the horror stories you hear, but they picked up on the second ring and had units dispatched within minutes. I think a lot of the bad experiences people share online might be from peak hours or major incidents that tie up resources. It's also worth noting that different areas have different response capabilities - some districts are just better funded and staffed than others. Really glad you were there to help that woman and that everything worked out. It takes a village sometimes, and good Samaritans like you make all the difference.

Post: What would you do with all this produce? Tomatoes and lettuce pretty fresh, the rest of it less so
Pictured: 3 artichokes of questionable freshness, 5 wrinkly eggplants, about 10 fresh tomatoes, about 10 decent potatoes, 3 heads of romaine lettuce, an onion, and a decent zucchini. It all needs to be used pretty soon though! I only have 3 people to feed, and it needs to be vegetarian. Help!

Reddit author comment: I'd turn the eggplant into [baba ganoush](https://www.loveandlemons.com/baba-ganoush/#wprm-recipe-container-43084).

I like potatoes roasted. I usually slice into wedges, toss with olive oil, and season with salt, garlic powder, and za'atar, roast at 400F for 40 minutes, flipping/stirring halfway through (I can and will eat the entire pan of these). You can also slice the onion fairly thin and add it to this, pretty tasty.

The tomatoes, you could slice them for a salad with the lettuce (or sandwiches) or cook them down into a soup or sauce.

Zucchini you could turn into [zucchini bread](https://www.budgetbytes.com/zucchini-bread/), or if you have the other ingredients, [these muffins](https://thecheekychickpea.com/vegan-morning-glory-muffins/) are SO GOOD and freeze well (I just microwave them for 45 seconds for 1, or 1:30 for 2 straight from the freezer but I'd start with 30 seconds for 1/ 1 minute for 2 and see)

claude-sonnet-4-0 comment: Oh wow, this is like a vegetarian cooking challenge! I'd definitely start with the less fresh stuff first. Those wrinkly eggplants are perfect for baba ganoush or roasted eggplant dip - just roast them whole until they're completely soft, then scoop out the flesh and blend with garlic, lemon, and tahini. The questionable artichokes can be salvaged if you trim off the outer leaves and use just the hearts in a pasta dish or risotto. For the fresh stuff, I'd make a huge batch of ratatouille using the eggplant, zucchini, tomatoes, and onion - it freezes beautifully and gets better with time. The potatoes could become a big batch of roasted potato salad, and those romaine heads would be perfect for Caesar salads to go alongside everything.

Serve that warm as a roasted veggie platter or mix it into pasta. For the artichokes, even if they’re not super fresh, you can try steaming them, then scraping out the edible parts and making an artichoke dip with some cheese, lemon, and breadcrumbs. The tomatoes and romaine are perfect for a big, fresh salad—throw in some croutons, maybe a basic vinaigrette, and you have a meal. If you need to use things up quickly, you could also simmer the tomatoes into a sauce to use over the roasted veggies or pasta. Finally, if you’re still left with extra, consider making a veggie frittata or casserole. Good luck! ... score: 0.5198

For the zucchini and eggplants, I’d suggest roasting or grilling them with some garlic and herbs like thyme or rosemary; roasting brings out amazing flavors and softens up the less fresh veg. The artichokes might be a bit tricky if they’re not super fresh, but you could try steaming or boiling them, then serving with a lemon-garlic dipping sauce. Potatoes are super versatile—consider making crispy roasted potatoes seasoned with paprika and garlic or even a hearty potato and vegetable stew to stretch everything out.

Post: What creative things can channel points be redeemed for?
I recently reached affiliate status on Twitch, which is a milestone for me. However, I'm not sure what can be redeemed with channel points. I generally stream Fortnite. Does anyone have any ideas?

Reddit author comment: It really depends on how technical and in depth you want to get with it. There are heaps of simple things you can think of yourself like little challenges etc. You can go from just having to do something yourself or change something manually on the stream, to automating some ridiculous things using bots and effects.

For example I have a redeem called Mugshot where people can enter custom text and it will then change to a scene where I have background removal on my camera so I appear in front of a criminal line up wall with the custom text appearing on a small board in front of me that says "Chat Police Dept." like it's what I'm being charged with, then after 2 seconds it freeze frames the camera with a camera shutter sound and iron bars slide into the scene from either side with a "cell doors being slammed shut" sound effect. Then it goes back to whatever scene I was on before. People really love that one but I have heaps more like that.

You could also do "Streamer has to sing next victory royale" or "Chat controls my keybinds for 2 minutes" (if you're feeling brave). The key is making rewards that create interaction and entertainment value. Start with cheaper point costs and adjust based on how often they're redeemed.
